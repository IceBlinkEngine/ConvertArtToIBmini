Combat Icons: Beetles

I give no credit to any artists, retouchers, recolorists or anyone who in some way, shape or
form had anything to do with this artwork. This is not to demean anyone or to claim credit myself,
but to avoid a lot more research and paperwork on my part. Unless otherwise noted, none of the
artwork is my doing.

For those who may be intersted: I used PaintShop Pro 3.0 <shareware> and UA256 to work on
these pictures and then convert them. All artwork has been tested to look as intended from within
UA itself. If it does not, don't blame me. They looked fine in my copy!  :)

What follows is a listing of the files contained in this archive and thier descriptions <as best as I
could describe them in so many words):

NOTE:  All of these icons have been recolored or modified in some way by myself. I was flipping through my Monster Manual and noticed all the beetles that were offered to gamers. We UA users have only the one, lonely Boring Beetle. And I have not run across him in any mods that I know of. So I decided to make the rest of them, using the Boring Beetle as a template. The descriptions for them were lacking except combat and ecology, so you'll excuse my artistic license, please...  As always... Enjoy! :)
