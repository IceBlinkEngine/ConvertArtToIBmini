Various unsorted combat icons
By Ghaaroth

I continue my annoying tradition of making completely random and chaotically
assorted art collections :-) This one contains only (thank Satan) combat
icons, but all sorts of them ;/ Oh well..

In order of groups rather than alphabetic:

1) Priests

Normal pose is based on icon from "cast spell" button in excellent shareware
RPG, Aethra Chronicles by Michael Lawrence. Of course, heavily retouched.

c_prist1.pcx - an initiate cleric, in green, with black hair and wooden staff
c_prist2.pcx - typical church priest or adventuring cleric, in blue, with
               brown hair and wooden staff with silver tip
c_prist3.pcx - a cardinal-sorta type, in red robe and cape, with long black
               hair and wooden staff with golden tip
c_prist4.pcx - a pope-sorta type, in white robe and cape, with short black
               hair and completely golden staff
c_prist5.pcx - a patriarch/hermit guy, with grey hair and beard, in yellow
               robe with rope belt and with crooked wooden staff

2) ...

Perhaps I am going to get my butt kicked for that, but here are icons made
from animated gifs of monsters from upcoming Interplay AD&D game, Baldur's
Gate. They aren't exactly fitting for UA (rendered, first, and isometric,
second), but I simply couldn't hold myself. All icons are large, even
kobold

c_basil.pcx  - a basilisk. It sucks.
c_bear.pcx   - a large bear. Good one.
c_kobold.pcx - a giant kobold. Call it gnoll..:-)
c_ogre.pcx   - mace-wielding ogre.
c_ogriln.pcx - an ogrillon, whatever is it.
c_stone.pcx  - same ogrillon, but made black'n'white. Would work as stone
               golem or giant.
c_tasloi.pcx - spear-wielding tasloi, whatever is it.
c_xvart.pcx  - dagger-wielding smurf, err, xvart, once again whatever is it.

3) ...

Once again my butt is in danger. Once I converted few combat icons from
Warlords-3 by Broderbund. Most of them sucked so I got rid of them, but two
are too good not to use them...

c_undbs2.pcx - an undead beast. Well, it doesn't look exactly like undead,
               but it's lovable nonetheless...
c_worm.pcx   - a "cave wyrm".

4) A tribute to Armand Mordeth

These are some of the icons prepared for cbody.tlb of my design-in-work. It
will contain a single prerolled PC, and cbody will consist of 49 icons of
same man in same clothes but with different weapons :-) All icons are based
on Dan Autery's elves. Why I upload them? Well, someone might find them
useful as guardsmen, soldiers and other cases where men in same dress but
with different weapons are common...

mordet01.pcx - standart icon, with long sword
mordet02.pcx - with short sword
mordet03.pcx - with broad sword
mordet04.pcx - with scimitar
mordet05.pcx - with bastard sword
mordet06.pcx - with hand axe
mordet07.pcx - with wooden club
mordet08.pcx - with dagger
mordet09.pcx - with flail
mordet10.pcx - with warhammer
mordet11.pcx - with mace
mordet12.pcx - with two-handed sword
mordet13.pcx - with battle axe (love this one)
mordet14.pcx - with halberd

5) Inspired by TSR artwork

Here are some of the icons I did after jpg's of TSR (ex)staff artists.
Originally I had lots of plans to do many of them (enough for separate
collection), but didn't had time now for several months, and so decided to
upload whatever I already did. They are too good to keep in desk :-))))) j/k

c_alias.pcx  - I love her. I loved the Finder's Stone novels, I loved her
               character, I loved Caldwell's covers, I loved Harri's Jade who
               used same picture in ASTTEOJA. The only thing I didn't loved
               was combat icon in UA/CAB. So I did my own, dressed as per
               Caldwell's "Azure Bonds" cover and loosely based on one of
               Hans' cbody icons.
c_dkcler.pcx - this is based on IIRC one of Dan Autery's fighters, as well as
               on nasty-looking fellow from one of Caldwell's covers to D&D
               Gazeteer series. This one is present in UA as "Dark Cleric",
               but for cleric his weapon reminds too much of a twohanded
               sword..:-)
c_drizzt.pcx - yeah, I uploaded him yet again ;x I hate him, and consider
               Salvatore's books extremely overrated, but...
c_goatcu.pcx - a fellow in goat cape by Elmore, known as half of "Sword vs
               Staff"
c_liriel.pcx - a drow sorceress, based on Elmore's picture which, as I once
               thought, portraits Liriel Baenre. I am no longer sure in it,
               but well...at least it is obvious it's drow sorceress :-)
c_lirold.pcx - first version of previous. She was reaaaally skinny back then,
               and only recently gained normal weight. It's quite different
               from previous, so someone might find it useful too..
c_rikus.pcx  - the nasty mul barbarian with just as nasty typical Athassian
               armor and weapons is back. Based on Brom's cover of "Crimson
               Legion". Damn, I cannot draw the bald head..;-(
