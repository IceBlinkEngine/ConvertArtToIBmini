           KnightHuma's
              Dragon Lance
                        Character collection


Greetings to all of you who have chosen to get this collection. I put it 
together with mostly my own original art, but I cannot take all of the 
credit. I've mentioned the origin of each combat icon in the 
descriptions below. I would like to say I have enjoyed becoming a 
part of the Unlimited Adventures community. I have a lot of fun with 
art and modules, and I hope you do too. Making my first module, 
Archmage of Krynn, was so fun! I spent a lot of time in making it, 
and added a lot of great art. I hope you have gotten it, but if you 
haven't, that's your choice and I understand. My second module, 
Beginning of Huma, was a lot of fun too. I used no imported art in 
this one, kind of to see if I could do it. I hope to make more modules 
in the future as well. If there are any problems, questions, or you just 
want to talk, e-mail me at KnightHuma (note: KnightHuma's new 
screen name is Red Magi). Thank you.


1. Tanis Half-Elven. Tanis is the leader of the party. His elven 
mother was raped by a human soldier, thus the half-breed. He is a 
born leader and a skilled fighter. Tanis played a major role in the 
defeat of the Dark Queen of Krynn when he killed the highest 
ranking HighLord, Ariakas. This picture was drawn by KnightHuma.

2. Tasslehoff Burrfoot. Tas is a loving kender. He would be classed 
as a thief, however he takes offense at that. Tas befriends an old 
mage named Fizban. Fizban and Tas get into all sorts of trouble 
together. This picture was drawn by Coric and color-modified by me, 
due to a color change in the conversion.

3. Caramon Majere. Caramon is a fierce fighter whose first priority 
in life is his "little brother" Raistlin. Caramon and Raistlin are 
identical twins, however they think and act much differently. 
Caramon falls in love with a barmaid named Tika, and they marry. 
This picture was drawn by KnightHuma (and color modified by 
Autery, due to color changes in the conversion to PCX format :).

4. Flint Fireforge. Flint is an old dwarf, who sees the rest of the 
group as his "children." He brought along the group, minus 
Goldmoon and Riverwind, when he traveled selling his blacksmith 
trade. This is how they came to be adventurers. This picture was 
drawn by KnightHuma.

5. Sturm Brightblade. Sturm was a knight of strong beliefs. It is 
possible that no knight represented the Knighthood as strongly as 
Sturm did since the ancient hero Huma. Knight Brightblade was a 
skilled fighter and had a fair and true heart. This picture was drawn 
by KnightHuma.

6. Raistlin Majere. Raistlin is a Red robe mage and is Caramon's 
brother. He is strong in the arts of magic, and was the youngest mage 
to ever take the tests of High Sorcery. In this test, his body was 
nearly destroyed, and he adapted gold skin and hourglass eyes. He is 
very mysterious and keeps many answers to secret questions. This 
picture was drawn by KnightHuma.

7. Riverwind. Riverwind was a plainsman from the human tribe of 
Que-shu. His beliefs of the old gods made his people drive him out 
of their lands in reproof of these gods. He came to a place where he 
battled and suffered, and was near death. However, the goddess 
Mishkal saved him and gave him the blue-crystal staff. He returned 
to give the staff to the princess of the tribe, his lover, but the people 
did not want to hear him and they both left. This picture was drawn 
by KnightHuma.

8. Goldmoon. She was the princess of the Que-shu tribe that wanted 
Riverwind dead. She gets the blue-crystal staff from Riverwind. 
With the staff, she earns the "greatest gift to all men." She is a very 
kind hearted woman, and tries to keep a smile on her face. The men 
of this group are always calm and patient when she speaks. This 
picture was originally drawn by SHAN520. I just made it look like 
Goldmoon with the staff (I'm tired of the female clerics with EITHER 
maces or flails).

Well, that's it! Thanks for reading all of this. If you have read the 
chronicles, then you know what becomes of everyone (Raistlin, 
wow!) and who loves who, and who dies, etc. I could've written a book 
on each character, but I limited myself as much as possible. I 
strongly advise people to read the Dragon Lance Chronicles. If you 
have, read the Twins trilogy! I hope to make more icons, and have 
been pondering the idea of making the first volume into a module! It 
would be rather big and would take a while, so I don't know. Any 
problems or suggestions, E-mail Red Magi (formerly KnightHuma), 
Thanx!!!!  8->


Notes from Autery:  The PC conversion of this collection was made 
possible through the efforts of Tirsheya.aol.com (MAC) and myself. 
Thank Tirsheya for the effort, without which, I could never have 
broken the mystic boundary between the Macintosh and the PC. :)
