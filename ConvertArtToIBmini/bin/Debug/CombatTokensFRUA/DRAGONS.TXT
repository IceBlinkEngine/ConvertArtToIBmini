This text file has what I recommend as the stats for the dragon combat icons in this collection.  You may adjust them as you see fit - for the most part, however, these are the "official" stats from the Monstrous Manual.  Intelligence (INT, below) includes both intelligence and wisdom - treat all other scores as 10.  PROT. FROM DRAGON BREATH is not listed in any of the monster descriptions - this is so you can have dragons face off against each other in battle - have some dragons as the enemies in an encounter, and others as allies.  It also means that the computer has to be more careful, especially when there are those nasty blue wyrms breathing lightning all over the place - it can't just have the dragons attack indiscriminately, or it will end up killing itself off.  Most of the dragons you can just add PROT. FROM DRAGON BREATH to if you want - for those with full slots you can just replace their SEE INVISIBLE ability, and give them the *detect invis.* spell.

Black dragons usually live in swamp, jungle, underwater, or subterranean settings.  They are abusive, quick to anger, and resent any kind of intrusion.  These dragons are fond of coins, and like all "true" dragons, are active at any time of day and can eat literally anything on the face of the earth.

Greens choose sub-tropical and temperate forests and caverns as their homes. They are bad-tempered, mean, cruel, and rude.  They love intrigue and seek to enslave other creatures, destroying those who refuse to become slaves.  They hate goodness, but their main enemies are Hill Giants, who live in the same areas and consider green dragon to be a delicacy.  They prefer to eat elves.

Reds live in tropical, sub-tropical, and temperate hills and mountains.  They are the most covetous and greedy of all dragons, and keep a mental inventory of their wealth accurate to the last copper.  They are exceptionally vain, considering themselves superior to all other forms of life.  They prefer to eat (demi) human maidens, and sometimes use 'charm' spells to get key villagers to regularly sacrafice maidens to them.

White dragons live in arctic plains and hills; mountains; and subterranean regions.  They tend to collect gems; their most hated enemies are frost giants and fiery creatures.

Deep dragons roam the Underdark and are great explorers.  They are usually found in well defended lairs in the Underdark.  They can assume the form of both a giant snake and a human or drow, allowing them to get places not many other creatures could reach - this also allows for elaborate deceptions.  Deep dragons avoid confrontations with other dragons and never fight or steal from others of their own kind; they prefer to eat kuo-toa and aboleth.

Dragon zombies are constructed from the remains of good dragons.  Through a dark ritual, the dragon's spirit is peverted and its mortal remains are animated.  Because of its undead condition, it hates all living beings, and will seek out and destroy any and all of its former friends and enemies.  Dragon zombies serve no purpose in any ecology save to destroy.

Yellow dragons prefer to live in the desert regions.  They are quite rare, and rarer still is the one who has been tamed to be a mount.  Their main enemies are brass dragons, who actively hunt the yellow dragons.  Their prefered foods are (Demi)humans and the unhatched eggs of brass dragons (they rarely get to enjoy this latter feast).

Bronze dragons are inquisitive and fond of (demi)humans.  They often polymorph into small, friendly animals so they can unobtrusively observe adventurers.  They thrive on simple challenges such as riddles and harmless contests.  They are fascinated by warfare and will eagerly join an army if the cause is just and the pay is good.  They breathe water and prefer lairs that, though dry, are accessible only from underwater.  Sahuagin and pirates are their most hated enemies.  They prize shark meat.

Copper dragons are incorrigible pranksters, joke tellers, and riddlers.  They are prideful and aren't good losers, though they are reasonable good winners.  They are rather selfish and greedy, and have a neutral alignment as far as wealth is concerned.  Coppers like to taunt and annoy their opponents.  Their main rivals are red dragons, because they inhabit the same areas; coppers will usually run for cover until they can equal the odds.

Golds are wise, judicious, and benevolent.  They often embark on quests to promote goodness, and aren't easily distracted from them.  Their lairs are secluded and always made of solid stone.  As w/ any good dragon, the experience is listed only in case of the ultra-rare evil loners - otherwise, the experience value should be 0.  Golds dine on small gems, and their main opponents are the evil red dragons.  Golds can live literally anywhere.

Silver dragons are kind and helpful.  They will cheerfully assist good creatures if their need is genuine.  Silvers prefer aerial lairs on secluded mountain peaks, or amid the clouds themselves.  Silvers seem to prefer human form to their own, and often share deep friendships w/ mortals.  Inevitably, however, they reveal their true form & go off to live a dragon's life for a time.  The worst foes of silvers are the evil red dragons.

She is the mortal enemy of Bahamut/Paladine.
