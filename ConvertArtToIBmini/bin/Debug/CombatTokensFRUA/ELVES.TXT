"Elven Warriors," by D. Autery (autery@aol.com)

This collection consists of 44 original combat icons, depicting my 
all-time favorite characters...  Elves!  ;D  More elves than you can 
shake a stick at...  Perhaps too darn many elves... (from a dwarven 
viewpoint, at least...). ;p  I hope you'll enjoy the collection 
regardless.  :>

Aside from a few improvements and the addition of 10 more combat 
icons, this is essentially the same archive as its AOL counterpart.  
The set consists of the following artwork:

c_arilyn  Arilyn Moonblade, of Forgotten Realms (tm) fame

c_elf (1 thru 12)  a dozen elven swordsmen

c_elfem (1 thru 9)  female elven sword fighters

c_elffb (1 thru 7) female elven archers

c_elffl  elven fighter with flail

c_elfhlb  elven halberdier

c_elflrd  an elven noble or royal guard

c_elfldy  an elven lady?

c_elfmb (1 thru 4) male elven bowmen

c_elfrd1  mounted elven lancer*  w/fighter (2 icons)

c_elfrd2  mounted elven bowman  w/archer (2 icons)

c_elfspr  elven spearman

c_elf2h (1 & 2)  2-handed sword fighters

*Full credit goes to ITB Yildro for the lance in the "action" pose 
of this pic.  Although 95% of the icon is original,  ITB's "Horse 
and Riders" collection was my inspiration for creating it.  :]

If you liked this collection, feel free to drop me a note or post a 
message on the boards. I'm always glad to hear what ya' think. :>

Have fun, happy gaming, and enjoy! :D
