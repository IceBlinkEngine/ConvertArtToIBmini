Greetings planescape fans!
   This archive consists of the factols to all factions and some of the 
sects that dot the planes. There is no factol to the Free League or the
Revolutionary League, though I included a member of the latter. 
Included are:


c_alison.pcx = Factol of the mercykillers, Alison Nilesia 
               (planar/female tiefling/wizard 8/LE)
c_ambar.pcx  = Factol of the Believers of the Source, Ambar Vergrove 
               (planar/male halfelf/ranger 19/NG)
c_anarch.pcx = A member of the Anarch's Guild, a sect based in Limbo. This
               member is a female githzerai and looks to be a mage.
c_darius.pcx = Factol of the Sign of One, Darius the Veyl
               (planar/female human/diviner 11/NG)
c_erin.pcx   = Factol of the Society of Sensation, Erin 'Darkflame' Montgomery
               (planar/female human/priestess of Diancecht 9/LG)
c_gith2.pcx  = Just another githzerai. :)
c_haskar.pcx = Factol of the Fraternity of Order, Hashkar
               (planar?/male dwarf/sage 0/LN)*some people think he's a 
               petitioner of Sigil, or even of the Lady of Pain herself!*
c_ingwe.pcx  = Factol of the Ring Givers, Ingwe
               (planar?/female dwarf?/commoner 0?/NG?)*no stats for Ingwe,
               All that's known is that she leads the ring giver sect out
               on Ysgard*
c_karan.pcx  = Factol of the Xaositects, Karan *most of the time, anyways!*
               (planar/male githzerai/fighter 9/CN)*chaotic neutral? Who'da
               thunk it?!?*

               death*
c_pentar.pcx = Factol of the Doomguard, Pentar
               (planar/female human/ranger 20/CN)*how she got chaotic neutral
               being a ranger is beyond me :P)
c_revo2.pcx  = Factotem of the Revolutionary League, Beringe
               (planar/male human/fighter 13, thief 13/NE)*though they have 
               no factol, they do have some high-ups... here's one of 'em.*
