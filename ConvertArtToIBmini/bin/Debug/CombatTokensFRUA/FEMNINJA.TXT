Red-Headed Female Ninjas
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to art upload #3!

This lovely little .ZIP file has a ton of combat icons that focus on three things I LOVE to think about...

Red-heads, Ninja & Red-headed Ninja!    }:>

And with that in mind, let me cover what comes in this fairly big .ZIP......


FEMNINJA .TXT: Is'nt she a beauty? so well written, and sexxy too. (Your reading it.)

HELPME.TXT: Uh-oh, its FEMNINJA.TXT's husband! (Or just some tech stuff, you pick.)

HISTORY.TXT: A little coverage on the real ninja and how they came to pass. : )

BLNDBLKD.PCX: The only one here thats blonde. This woman in the black dress is
leading the pack here, so show some respect.

RHBSNIN.PCX: This scantily clad red-headed ninja is wearing a one piece suit with mini
skirt and carrying a ninja-to.

RHFNIN**.PCX: Several different icons of our red-headed heroine wielding oriental
weapons......
    BG: Blowgun. A versatile tool, this can be anything from a weapon to a useful tool.
    BH: Bare Handed (Time for some Ninjutsu moves! One of my favorites.)
    BS: Bo Staff. Usually bamboo, the hardwood is hard to cut or break.
    GF: Gunsen. This is a war fan used more like a small shield than just to strike blows.
    HB: Hanbo. This is called a "Half-Staff". Ninja also use their sheaths like hanbos.
    HY: Hankyu. Also called a "Half-Bow" this is a small bow often used by ninja.
    JA: Ninja-to. The main weapon of a ninjas arsenal; the sword has many uses.
    KG: Kusari-gama. A combo of Kama and a chain; it is favored by peasants & ninja.
    KS: Kama. A straight-bladed sickle & farmer's tool; ninja like this inconspicuous tool.
    MG: Manriki-gusari. A length of chain with weights at the end; it has many uses too.
    NC: Nekode. Ninja climbing claws that can be used to scale walls and as a weapon.
    NH: Naginata. A kind of halberd with swordlike blade; women prefer this weapon too.
    NK: Nunchaku. A pair of rods connected by short chain; ninja also favor this tool.
    NT: Nage teppo.A kind of grenade popular with ninja; it can hold powder, smoke, exc.
    SB: Bokken. A wooden sword; this ninja-to version could be used as a blunt weapon.
    SS: Shuriken. Also known as throwing stars; they come in many shapes & sizes.
    ST: Sai. A kind of dagger/trident like weapon; also used to fend and catch blows.
    TB: Tetsu-bishi. Another form of caltrop; these can be used to hamper movement.
    TD: Tanto. A small dagger with small or nonexistent hand guard; a favored ninja knife.
    TH: Tonfa. This handle-like weapon is a favorite for ninja in weapon outlawed areas.
    TS: Three-section staff. A staff like weapon with three rods linked by short chain.
    WM: Our heroine wielding her ninja-to. But now she's unmasked and ready to fight.

FEM*NIN.PCX: Female ninja in different kinds of suits for different kinds of terrain......
    B: Brown. (Rockys, Brown-woods, exc.)
    C: Clay. (Light brown. Good for wet mud or clay like ground.)
    G: Green. (Heavy foliage, green-woods, exc)
     I : Ice. (Very light blue. Good for icy areas or maybe shallow water.)
    M: Moss. (A deep kind of green. Good for mossy or swamp like areas.)
    N: Neon green. (A very bright green. Useful for grassy-like areas and the like.)
    O: Orange. (strange color. Maybe good around oranges or more formal events.)
    P: Purple. (A plum like color. This seems more for formal events than anything.)
    W: White. (Good for white areas like snow. Good movie ninja usually wear this color.)
    Y: Yellow. (Areas like sand or anything yellow, maybe even gold.)

FEM*NINB.PCX: Same as above, only bare handed and with sword strapped to back.

RHSWDWST.PCX: A red-head with top. (sleeveless version of the above.)

RHSWORDW.PCX: A red-headed swordswoman.

RHSWRDW2.PCX: Same red-head, but this time with collar. (Getting a tad kinky? :>)

RHSWRDW3.PCX: Yet again the same red-head, but this time with open top. (I can't
really explain this one, but it is a good one and another one of my favorites.)

NINJA2H.PCX: Finally, there is this little number. I did not convert or alter this but it has
been a long time since I found this little combat pic. and you can't really find it around
much anymore so here it is. This is a ninja with two swords and the arthur never bothered to mark the pic. so kudos to whomever put this little piece of work together.
Consider this a special treat for all you UAer's out there. (Hey, maybe I'll start a trend!)


A very special thank you to both Nyx Night & Ariel Brennan for the combat icon that all
the icons above were converted from (Thats right, their all copies!) called "RedHair.pcx"
from "Femicons.zip" in the UA art library. Without such art these would not be anywhere
near as good (or as shapely) as they turned out to be.

Being the mysterious and wilily EMP. that I am, my art comes few and far between. So
far, my last two art downloads "FF2 Airships" & "Tavern Walls" have received good
praise and had a excellent download count. My specialty being alteration and
conversion; I prefer to work when the inspiration hits me. This usually comes as a
fevered and sudden hit that can last days when its the right art at the right time.

With three art uploads and an adventure on the way, you can be sure (For the time being) that this is NOT the last you will hear of...

                            "The EMP."

If you have any comments, complaints, questions or worship (The latter's nice)
send them to EMPIRE B@AOL.com and tell me what you think.





* The Iga, Koga & Fuma ninja were among many of the ninja clans of Japan from the
late 12th century to the 17th century. Each had a formal color that was a sign of a clan.</PRE></HTML>
