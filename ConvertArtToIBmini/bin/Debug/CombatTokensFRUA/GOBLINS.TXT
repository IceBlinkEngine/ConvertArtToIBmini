Goblin Combat Icons

There are 17, drawn mostly by me.  I'm not sure if I drew the amazon, but
I think I did.  It's been a long time.  Most use parts from Autery's
dwarves and elves.  A few were used in Lhado's Messengers, my upcoming mod.

c_gbarc*.pcx:   Goblin Archers
c_gbaxe*.pcx:   Goblin Axemen
c_gbfla1.pcx:   Goblin with Flail [Goblin Priest?]
c_gbmac1.pcx:   Goblin with Mace [Goblin Priest?]
c_gbswd*.pcx:   Goblins with Swords
                (includes Goblin Sarge & Captain from Lhado's Messengers)
c_gbxbw*.pcx:   Goblins with Crossbows (incl. goblin "colonel")
c_gbwiz*.pcx:   Goblin Wizards
