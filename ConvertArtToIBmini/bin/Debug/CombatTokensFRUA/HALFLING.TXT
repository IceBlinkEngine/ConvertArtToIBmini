"Halflings," by D. Autery (autery@aol.com)

This collection consists of 17 original combat icons, though two 
(hlftr1 & hlftr2) are modifications of work I've done in the past.  I 
hope ye' don't mind that little indiscretion, and that you'll enjoy the 
collection regardless.  :>

The set consists of the following artwork:

c_hlfmu1:  a male halfling wizard (or dark-robed priest, if you like ;). 
Though halfling mages don't (currently) exist as player characters in 
UA, the work done by Kaviyd, Peter Delaney, Dan Durgin, and many 
others has made them a distinct possibility for the future.  :]

c_hlfmu2  a female halfling magess (or staff-wielding priestess)

c_hlfpr1  male halfling priest

c_hlfpr2  male halfling priest (or flail-using fighter)

c_hlfth (1 thru 3)  female halfling thieves

c_hlfth4  male halfling thief

c_hlfth5  male halfling thief (based on the thief icon in UA).

c_hlftr1  male halfling fighter.  This is a modification of the icon I 
created of Regis Meek (Exiles collection).

c_hlftr2  male halfling fighter (modification of my dwarven 
champion icon, from the Dwarves collection).

c_hlftr3  male halfling fighter.  Aha!  An original... ;p

c_hlftr (4 thru 8)  female halfling fighters

If you liked this collection, feel free to drop me a note or post a 
message on the boards. I'm always glad to hear from you. :>  I'd like to 
thank the many folks who've done exactly that; your comments and 
suggestions have been (and still are) a continuing inspiration.  :]  I'd 
also like to tip my hat to the many fine artists in the UA community.  
To paraphrase Abbot H, "good artwork is inspired by truly formidable 
competition."  You've certainly provided that competion (friendly, 
though it may be ;) and more than enough inspiration.  If any of my 
work is good, it's because of you.  :)

Until next time, have fun, happy gaming, and enjoy! :D
