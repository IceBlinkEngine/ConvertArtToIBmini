  The Iga, Koga & Fuma ninja were among many of the ninja clans of Japan from the
late 12th century to the 17th century. During the Kamakura era, many samurai and their
families fell out of favor with the court. In order to insure their safety these samurai
moved to such areas as the Iga and Koga provinces to live as farmers. They began to
sell their skills to Daimyo of that time and from this was when the idea of the ninja truly
took hold. Each clan, isolated as they were, developed specific espionage and combat
techniques known as "Ninjutsu" which was also the name of their deadly unarmed art.

From the 12th to 16th century the ninja found many opportunities for employment in the
chaos of the time. During the more stable Tokugawa shogunate of the 17th to 19th
centuries, the ninja found less a need for their skills and therefore less jobs. As their
numbers started to lower since no one wanted to go thru the painful and somewhat
dangerous training, the last two major clans to remain became part of the palace.

The Iga, whom were the major power of ninja before they had suffered near extinction at
the hands of Oda Nobunaga, and whom survived by forming small clans around japan,
were given the inside of Edo palace to guard. (Edo was the name of the city we now
know as Tokyo.)

The Koga, whom faired better than the Iga within the past few years and were one of the
few clans to survive the years of war, were given the outside of Edo palace to guard.

Ultimately, the ninja disappeared as time went on (By name anyway) and became a
modern fixture of things. Some modern historians believe that the last of the true ninja
died during WWII (or earlier), while others believe that the modern combat and
espionage techniques now being taught under the name Ninjutsu are genuine, linear
descendants of the real ninja skills.</PRE></HTML>
