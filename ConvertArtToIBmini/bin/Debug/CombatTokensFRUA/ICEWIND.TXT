The Icewind Dale Collection, by D. Autery (autery@aol.com).

This collection is based strongly on the "Icewind Dale Trilogy," by 
R.A. Salvatore (whose novels also include "The Dark Elf Trilogy," 
and "The Cleric Quintet," all of which are well worth reading :). It 
consists of the following .pcx files:

c_bar1  female (wolf-clan) barbarian

c_bar2  male (wolf-clan) barbarian

c_catbri  Catti-Brie, adopted human daughter of the dwarf, 
Bruenor Battlehammer.  Catti-Brie doesn't play the role of a major 
heroic figure in the earlier stories, but proves well able to take care 
of herself, even more so after Bruenor gives her the magical bow, 
Talmuril, "the heart seeker." ;).

c_dwaxe2  female dwarven fighter/noble (of Bruenor 
Battlehammer's clan), armed with a battle-axe.

c_dwaxe3  female dwarven axe-woman

c_dwftr4  female dwarven swordsman

c_panthr  black panther -- Drizz't DoUrden's magical companion, 
Guenhwyvar.  I noticed a minor glitch in the combat graphics of 
the previous icon I'd uploaded of Guen, so I touched it up and 
added a claw slash. I hope you enjoy the results. ;]

c_regis  Regis, a halfling (fighter?)/thief, and long time friend of 
Drizz't Do'Urden, as well as the other major Icewind Dale heroes.  
Trouble seems to follow Regis wherever he goes -- notably 
(throughout most of the story), this trouble takes the form of the 
assassin, Artemis Entreri...

c_rtemis  Artemis Entreri, a cunning, evil, human fighter of 
virtually unsurpassed skill -- Artemis makes his living as an 
assassin... and he's quite good at his job. ;)

c_rtmis2  Artemis Entreri (again;), dressed in "working" clothes.

c_wulfgar  Wulfgar, initially a member of the wolf-clan, Wulfgar 
was captured by Bruenor in the battle of ten towns.  Bruenor 
taught the young barbarian the value of friendship before releasing 
him, and Wulfgar proved to be a valuable friend and ally in return.

Notes:  If you're looking for more icons I've done relating to 
Icewind Dale, you can find Drizz't DoUrden in the "Exiles" set, 
while Bruenor Battlehammer, Thibbledorf Pwent, and the dwarves 
of Bruenor's clan are uploaded under the title "Dwarves!"...I'd be 
more than happy to see them in your mods, whether they're based 
on the Icewind Dale trilogy, or anything else, for that matter. :D

If you liked this collection, feel free to drop me a note or post a 
message on the boards. I'm always happy to hear what ya' think. :]

Have fun, happy gaming, and enjoy! :D
