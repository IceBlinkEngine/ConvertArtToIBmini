RE:  Redone02.Zip

 This is my second upload of recolored art.  Once again, if any of the 
original artists do not want me to recolor their art, PLEASE inform me!!
Also note:  Note all Icons may appear the same in the game as they might 
when using an art program such as Neopoint or Deluxe Paint (I dunno....I 
guess I wasn't paying attention.).
I only got one reply to my first upload, so PLEASE drop me a line and let
me know what you think. YES, that means YOU!!!!!
In case you didn't notice, I am doing alot of Red mages.  The reason is
because I would LOVE to see a mod. using the Red Wizards of Thay, and hope
to inspire someone. =)
  Once again, I would like to thank all the original artists:
Autery
Louminator (probably spelled wrong)
and everyone else (sorry...I just don't know all the names)
Without your hard work, I would be lost, not to mention having to use those
boring icons that comes with FRUA!
Enjoy the art (and to those mod makers, if you need info on 
The Forgotten Realms, E-mail me..I think I may be able to help).
