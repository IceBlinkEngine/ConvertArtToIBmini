Re: Redone03.zip

Dear Downloader,
  First off, thank you for downloading this file. I hope you enjoy/like 
enclosed files. I know I enjoyed recoloring them. Thank you to all the
original artists and or capturers who gave me access to such great original
art work.  I did not try to improve on your art (That would be impossible),
I only wanted a little variety. I hope you don't mind.
Enclosed you will find the following files:

Drow 
	@Drow15:	Ok, the original icon wasn't a drow, but I think
			it makes a pretty nice one. Do you agree?
	@Drow16:	Yes, its the same Icon as @drow15, but recolored.
			I think I like this one better.  The leather look 	
			really fits for the supposed time period of 	
			the Forgotten Realms I think.
	@Drow2:		I dunno how the numbers got so mixed up. I just work
			here.  I've redone a redo I did. (HUH?) I did this
			because on the original redo, I noticed an odd little
			mistake that made the femal drow look really funky
			(did I say funky?) around her neck/facial area.
	@Drow20:	I believe this icon is originally from Gateway to
			the Savage Frontier.  She makes a good drow.
	@Btlrd1a:	I made the drow on the beetle look drowish (dark skin).
		
Humans 
	@Archr1a-@Archr1d: 	I wanted to be able to rep. several nations/cities/
				empires so I made enough to do so. These were GREAT
				original works and the true artist deserves a 
				great deal of praise. THANK YOU!
	@Banit1a-@Banit1f: 	Same reason as above, i wanted several reps.
	@Clrc1a:		One of my top 100 fav. icons
	@Cult1a-@Cult1i:	Same deal once again.
	@Elmin1a-@Elmin1c:	Elminster!!!!! I just did this one cause 
				Elminster RULZ!
	@FitrF2a:		Let me translate. Fighter Female 2a. She was
				the icon I recolored, and then used for a drow.
	@FitrM5a-@Fitrm5h:	Fighter Male. Same deal as the archers. Once 
				again, GREAT work to the original artist!
	@Mage10a:		I believe this icon is known as a necromancer?
				The original was a bluish gray. Whats up with that?
				I made it human looking.
	@MageF3a-@MageF3c:	I like this one. Its also one of the drow icons
				in this download.
	@Rider1a-@Rider1f:	Same as FitrM5a. GREAT Work. PLEASE send me
				more if you've done any.
	@Shmn1a-@Shmn1c:	Autery, great work! But then, your my Absolutely
				Favorite artist.  
	@Sirdut1:		Ok, I was trying for something else, and kind of
				screwed up...but it doesn't look to bad.
	@Spy01a-@Spy01b:	What? You think there is only one type of
				spy uniform?
	Akabar1-Akabar8:	Perfect for any desert adventures.

Monsters
	@Behir02:		The original blue behir was just to much for
				my eyes. I think this one looks more...
				natural!?!?!
	@Drag1a-@Drag1f:	I think they look nice. Maybe you could use 
				them for Great wyrms or mature adults?
	@Golem1a-@Golem1e:	Golems.  Don't ask me what that sign about
				colors changing with level means..I dunno.
	@Lich13:		This one made my top 10 list. Its a lich
				dressed in a leather robe/cloak. What do you
				think?
	@Shmbl1a:		A shambleing mound of rock/dirt
	@Shmbl1b:		" 	"	"  of swamp stuff? ;)
	@Shmbl1c:		"	"	"  of lava?
	@Shmbl1d:		"	"	"  of stone
	@Shmbl1e:		"	"	"  of ice or lightning
	@Shmbl1f:		"	"	"  of Water.
			**** You can also use the above @Shmbl1a-f for elementals?
	@SnkIce1:		A pyrosnake changed into a cryosnake.
	@SnkWtr:		A pyrosnake transmorphed into a hydrosnake.
	@Spidr20:		A gas spider? 
	@Spidr21:		A fire Spider?
			**** I don't remember what number I left off on with 
				past files. If you have already downloaded
				spiders with the above names/numbers, go ahead
				and change em.
	@StnglmW-@StnglmZ:	I don't care for these, but maybe you will.
	@Troll1a:		A Firetroll. Yes, I know there are already
				firetroll icons out there. I like this better.
	@Troll1b:		A Stonetroll. See Troll1a.
	@Troll1c:		An EarthTroll (or maybe wood troll?)
	@Troll1d:		An Ice or Lightning Troll.
	@DrgRDR1:		I touched up this icon of a Red Dragon &
				rider.
