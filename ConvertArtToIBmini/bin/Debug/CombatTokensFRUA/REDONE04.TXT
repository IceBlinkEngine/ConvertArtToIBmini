@Abolth2, originally by Louminator, is recolored to look
	more 'natural', with earth tones.
@BC-Vet2 is a wide icon of a Black Circle Vet firing a 
	fireball.
@BC-Vet3 is a wide icon of a Black Circle Vet firing a
	lightning bolt.
@BtleRD2 thru @BtleRD7 is an assortment of recolored icons
	of a mage riding a bullete
@Captn01 thru Captn06 is an assortment of Guard Captains.
@Firshd2 is recolored to appear as an ice shade rather than
	a fireshade. Also usable as a water shade.
@Firshd3 is recolored to appear as a gas shade rather
	than a firshade.
@Genrl01 thru Genrl15 is an assortment of war generals.
@Guard17 thru @Guard23 is an assortment of city guards 
	originally done by ITB Yilbro (I really like the
	way ITB's name looks on the icon sheet. Don't you?)
@Guard24 thru @Guard28 is also an assortment originally 
	by ITB Yilbro. These are another set of city guards.
@Harpy01 is an icon of a harpy that actually flies! Ok,
	she really just kind of jumps...
@Jagres2. She has skin colored skin now!!! Thanks ITB Yilbro
@Minion1 is a retouched icon of a red minion of bane.
	I think it looks better totally red and w/o the
	green and blue spots.
@Minion4 is a recolored icon of an orange minion of bane.
@Raist02 is originally by Silvermaine.  This icon was
	fun to redo. I think the lightning looks better
	with an art viewer than it does in the game,
	but either way it looks pretty good.
@Spy04 thru @Spy11 an assortment of Luskan spy icons originally
	by ITB Yilbro.
@Valgmn1 thru @Valgmn3 are icons of that evil baddy Valgamon.
	I have made this icon into a large icon with
	red armor and a blue cape.  You can choose between
	Valgamon with a magical long sword or Valgamon
	with a magical dagger.
@Web01 thru @Web02: I've redone and done so many spiders,
	I figured it was time we had some spider webs.
	I couldn't figure out how to make them 'hang' on 
	something, so they kind of just float in space,
	but this is just a game, so use your imagination!

I hope you like and use these redone icons in your modules.
I have really enjoyed redoing them, and I hope the original
artists don't mind. If any of you do, PLEASE let me know.
