SHAMARON.ZIP should contain the following four files:

P_SHERR1.PCX  Shamaron (Sherri) in a normal, conversational mood. ;)
P_SHERR2.PCX  A slightly annoyed Shamaron -- which could be a prelude to..
C_SHAMRN.PCX  Combat icon of Sherri, modified from the one I sent in to
              UANL12 for the "UA City" project. :]
SHAMARON.TXT  This text file.

Greetings and Salutations! :D

It's been awhile since I've uploaded any new artwork, but I'm still plugging
away. ;>  This archive is one example of what's been keeping me busy. :] I
hope you like it. :)

These pics have a wee bit of history to them.. ;)  While I've only recently
(about a year-and-a-half ago) delved into the world of computer artwork,
the figure depicted here has been with me for quite some time.  Shamaron
was the first character I created for AD&D, back in 1983.  She quickly
became my favorite, and has been ever since. :]

As with any favorite persona, she has something of my personality -- high
ideals, values, and beliefs, tempered by compassion and an understanding of
her own (and other people's) limitations.  She's not perfect, but she does
the best she can. ;)

Although the work is original, I'd like to thank Jeff Smith, a good friend,
for creating the original line drawing upon which the pics were based, and
Dennis Constantino (Dika Wolf), for continuing to write inspiring artwork
articles for the UA Newsletter. :]  He, and every other fine artist who's
submitted work to the UA forum, has been a strong influence on everything
I've drawn.  And, of course, the remaining credit goes to the many folks
who've downloaded my work, used it in their designs, and/or sent a note
with a friendly bit of encouragement. :)  Without you, very little (if any)
of my artwork would exist. :]

And now, allow me to introduce you to:

Shamaron Na' Alexandria

Race:  Gray Elf
Age:   197
Sex:   Female

Class:  Fighter/Mage
Level:  8/12
Alignment:  Lawful Good

Str: 17 (24 with girdle of giant strength)
Int:  19
Wis:  18
Dex:  19
Con:  19
Chr:  18

Hit Points:  100

AC:  -12

Magic Items:  Bracers AC 2, Ring of protection +6/+1, Cloak of 
Displacement, Boots of Speed, Ring of Wizardry, Robe of the 
Archmagi, Girdle of Storm Giant Strength, Staff of the Magi

Special and/or artifacts:
  The Adamantite Torque;  a gift from the goddess, Mielikki, the 
torque prevents vorpal attacks from affecting its wearer.  It also 
confers 15% magic resistance, cumulative with other magic 
resistance items.
  Crystalflame;  An elven Holy Sword +5, this weapon is sentient, 
may cast "heal" once/day, and confers a bonus 50% magic 
resistance above that noted previously.  With the robe of the 
archmagi and the adamantite torque, this gives Shamaron a magic 
resistance of 70%.

Note:  All of Shamaron's major stat's (save charisma) were raised 
magically -- via tomes, manuals, and the like.  Her levels were 
likewise raised above racial maximums through a Manual of 
Puissant Skill at Arms and a Libram of Silver Magi.

Background:
Shamaron (Sherri to her closest friends) was orphaned early in her 
childhood (she was 6 years old).  Goblins and drow slew her 
family and the others in her village, but Shamaron was well-hidden 
by her mother as the attack began.  Her mother died within view.

The child was found by a druid, who took her to a human city 
(Malacos) where she was raised by foster parents.  Her new father, 
a city guardsman, taught her to fight, and later, a mysterious 
woman named Shadow taught her the art of magic.

She has seen much in a limited (from an elven viewpoint) span of 
time -- her powers vastly exceed that shown above.  Nicknamed 
"The Guardian," Shamaron is far more caring of humans than many 
elves, and uses her powers to aid them whenever possible.  Often 
merciful, sometimes aloof, Shamaron despises drow, hates goblins, 
and detests braggarts (which, sadly, encompasses many adventurers 
and nobles).

The latter is encompassed by her motto:
 "Deeds, not words."
  :::Let ones actions speak for themselves...:::

Enjoy!  ;)
