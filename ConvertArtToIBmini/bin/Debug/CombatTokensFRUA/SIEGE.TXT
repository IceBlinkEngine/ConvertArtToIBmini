      The "Siege and Conquest" collection,  by Autery

This directory contains combat icons for use with SSI's Advanced 
Dungeons & Dragons' Unlimited Adventures (tm).  Some of these 
icons will be used in Kaviyd's upcoming module, Culwych and 
Owen. To demonstrate the uses of the siege icons and the sprite of 
the jouster, Kaviyd has also created a demo, Jousts and Siege, which 
is both useful... and entertaining (and will showcase in UANL11 ;).

The following descriptions and suggested stats are based almost 
entirely from the work Kaviyd has put into using these icons:

  C_BATRAM;  Combat icon of a battering ram with crew.
  Class: fighter, Lvl: ftr 4, hit points: 40, THAC0=15, Morale: 30, 
AC: 4, Move: 6, Special: may be held/charmed, immune to 
death/vorpal, #ATT: 4/2 for 1d2, Items: flail +5, Special #2: half 
damage weapons.

  C_BLISTA;  Icon of a manned ballista.
  Class: mage, Lvl: ftr 4, hit points: 30, THAC0=15, Morale: 30, AC: 
4, Move: 0, Special:  may be held/charmed, immune to death/vorpal, 
#ATT: 2/2 for 1d2, Items: lt. crossbow +3, 20 bolts +5, longsword, 
Special #2: half damage weapons, vulnerable to fire.

  C_CATPLT;  Icon of a light catapult w/crew.
  Class: mage, Lvl: ftr 6, hit points: 40, THAC0=14, Morale: 35, AC: 
3, Move: 3, Special:  may be held/charmed, immune to death/vorpal, 
#ATT: 4/2 for 1d8, Items: sling +5, longsword, Special #2: immune 
to fear, half damage weapons, vulnerable to fire.

  C_HVYCAT;  Icon of a heavy catapult w/crew.
  Class: mage, Lvl: ftr 8, hit points: 50, THAC0=12, Morale: 40, AC: 
2, Move: 0, Special:  immune to death/vorpal, #ATT: 6/2 for 1d8+3, 
Items: staff-sling +5, Special #2: immune to fear, half damage 
weapons, vulnerable to fire.

  C_M60;  Icon of... yup, a machine gun -- for those really tough 
monsters. ;)
  Class: mage, Lvl: ftr 6, hit points: 30, THAC0=10, Morale: 30, AC: 
3, Move: 0, Special:  may be held/charmed, immune to death/vorpal, 
#ATT: 2/2 for 1d6+3, Items: Dart of the hornet's nest x5 (or more), 
dart +2 (as desired), Special #2: half damage weapons, immune fear.  
Note:  unless you have access to the item editor, the dart of the 
hornet's nest is the only one I know of that will simulate the multiple 
attacks of this icon.

  C_SIEGE;  Icons of unmanned heavy catapult, light catapult, and 
ballista. As animated objects, these make reasonably believable foes.

  C_WALL2;  Icon of a defended wall section.  ***Note*** this 
icon uses colors beyond the combat palette, so it's colors will mutate 
when you import it into the game.  However, when you use it, choose 
"rock" for indoor combat art (p2 of dungeon Global Info screen), and 
the colors will turn out well (in the combat).
  Class: mage, Lvl: ftr 10, hit points: 100, THAC0=10, Morale: 50, 
AC: 2, Move: 0, Special: immune to death/vorpal, #ATT: 4/2 for 
1d6, Items: shortbow, 100 arrows, Special #2: 1/2 damage f/cutting  
weapons, +4 full damage, immune weapons <+3, immune to fear.

  C_WALL3;  Same icon as above except that this uses the normal 
palette. While the icon doesn't look quite as good with the rock 
combat art as wall2, it can be used with other combat art fairly well.

Notes:
  Class: making the moster (p.1) a "mage" keeps it from moving in 
combat. It's actual saving throws (and the weapons it is allowed to 
use) are calculated from the class chosen on page 2.
  Level: This could vary, depending on the crew and the saving throw 
benefits it should receive. Since it represents one (or more) figures, 
plus the siege machine, it should be at least 2 levels higher than the 
actual crew.
  Hit points:  varies, according to crew level and defenses of the siege 
machine.  I've used the figures from Kaviyd's demo (or a best guess 
for icons that weren't used).
  THAC0:  varies by level of crew.
  Morale: varies -- represents the crew's confidence in the power of 
the weapon, but should usually be higher for larger crews.
  AC: varies, depending on what the party is expected to destroy (the 
siege machine or the crew...) -- your choice. ;)
  Move:  Some machines can't be moved -- while setting their class 
(p.1) to mage prevents them from moving forward, their movement 
must be set to 0 to prevent them from fleeing when losing a battle or 
affected by fear.
  Special:  varies, for the same reason AC does.
  #ATT:  This mainly effects melee (up close) combat. It could vary, 
depending on the number of crew members, their level, and the 
weapons you've decided to give them.
  Items:  These are the special weapons required to make the icons 
"work."  For the ballista and wall, any bow will work for the combat 
graphics.  Catapults work well with slings or staff-slings -- the high 
magical value is intended to represent the massive damage potential 
of the weapons (though you could certainly be more accurate by 
creating special weapons via the item editor).  Since the walls (in 
this case) are meant to be invulnerable to player attacks, only siege 
machines should have any chance to damage them.  The special 
defenses of the walls and the high value of the weapons used by the 
siege machines help to ensure that.  To prevent players from getting 
the siege weapons, the combat should be set to "no treasure from 
monsters."  Add a "combat treasure" event before the combat (with an 
appropriate number of weapons/armor for the opponents), and you 
can keep the player from ever knowing about this. Weapons of +3 
(or better) value should be rare or impossible to find in a game that 
uses the wall icons.

  C_FIGHTER (1 thru 3):  Two fighters & a knight.
  C_FIGHTER (4 thru 10):  My crusader collection, this set contains 
6 fighters and 1 knight, all with a cross on their shields.
  C_FIGHTER (11 thru 13):  One fighter & 2 knights with a serpent 
on their shields.  These may be generic enough to be used as allies or 
foes -- the shield device is the same as one used for a player icon.
  C_FIGHTER (14 thru 16):  Three "sword" knights.  I had the 
Dragonlance setting in mind when I made these.
  C_FIGHTER (17 thru 19):  Three knights of the Grail -- these have 
a golden chalice upon their shields.

  The fighter icons originated in much the same way as my dwarven 
icon collection;  a few people mentioned liking the dwarves and 
asked for icons of fighters (funny how that works, isn't it... ;).  That 
was just the start, though.  The majority of the icons were created for 
(and hopefully play a key role) in Kaviyd's adventure, "Culwych and 
Owen" -- a medieval campaign where knights, fighters, siege 
machines, and perhaps some advice from Sir Robin (run away, run 
away... ;), play a prominent role.  I've created a mixture of knights 
and fighters with different shield devices, mainly to give designers 
the ability to create their own armies (without having to rely upon 
the dissimilar icons already in the game).  Barring that, some of them 
might even make good NPC's. :P

  S_JOUST2;  Sprite of a jouster (heavily modified from a pic in the 
Xeen (tm) collection).  The one, and only, non-original in this 
collection -- Among other things, I drew most of the horse's lower 
body, though I'd like to beg forgiveness from any horse lovers out 
there if it's (ummm...) a wee bit out of proportion... :p

Have fun!  And, by all means, send me your comments, tips, 
criticism, and/or compliments (the latter "is" preferred, of course :P).
