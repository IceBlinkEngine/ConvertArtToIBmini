Vix's Dwarves (or the Great Dwarf Transmogrification)

As I was working on my design, Thunderdelve, I came to the realization 
that there are just not that many dwarven battle icons! Dan Autery had
made some awesome ones, less than a score. And of these dwarven folk, 
none were armored in anything less than chain mail (or ring mail, if 
you wanted to quibble ;>). Even worse, there were no obvious females 
of the species in evidence! :(  (OK... there -are- two that may or may
not be gals... I first took them to be very young males, but they just
could be somewhat androgynous! ;Þ).

With these egregious oversights in mind, I set to work rectifying the 
situation! (hehe)

As Dan is considered to be UA's premier Icon Artist (though my hat's 
off to hans, Dika, Half, Keyhd, and a handful of others), and as his 
dwarven icons were (and still are) the best out there, I cast a magical
slumber upon his creatures and took them into my secret Examination 
Chamber in the Lair!

There, I studied, poked, prodded, probed, and magicked the hairy creatures
to learn of their natures and physiological makeup. Soon, armed with my 
new knowledge, I began to modify Dan's dwarves...

A few simple spells changed the coloring of their armor and other attire.
Slightly more complicated incantations were needed to change some of their
physical characteristics. A few added weapons and other odd and ends were
easily aquired from my cache guarded by Draggy... (she really hates to lose
stuff from that trove of hers, though! ;/).

Then the hardest portion of the Great Dwarf Makeover was at hand... creating
females!

I pondered this for many hours. I researched ancient tomes, scoured my spell
notes for clues or ideas. Finally, in a fit of despair, I contacted a former
teacher of mine. He listened to my dilema and admonished me for meddling in 
the purvues of the gods... but, as he was a rougeish scamp himself at one 
time, he imparted to me the location of a magical device that will instantly
change the sex of a creature! (Page 170 of the 2nd Edition Dungeon Master's
Guide, 1989 printing...) ;>

After calling in a few favors, I soon found myself in possession of a chestful
of the magical sex changers... With a micheivous grin, I placed the devices on 
several of the unsuspecting male dwarves...

Praise the Dark Maiden, it worked! I now had fully realized female dwarves in
my Lair. A bit more work (they needed some bust enhancement and a slight shave)
and they were ready!

But, I still didn't have enough dwarves, male -or- female... :(

Once again, I raided Dan's talent and made off with several of his wonderful 
Duergar, or Dark Dwarves. These, too, I hied down into the bowels of my Lair
and worked my shapechanging magicks upon them. Even changing one of them into
a ravishing gal of a dwarf!

So, now you have a wider selection of our earth loving friends to enjoy...
and some feminine company for he originals, too! 

(Oh, btw, none of the metamorphed dwarves has any recollection of what happened
to them, and I had prudently made clones of Dan's originals and returned those 
where I found them!)
