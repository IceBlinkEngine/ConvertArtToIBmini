DESCRIPTION
        Wraith Dragons appear as dark forms that resembles what
they looked like in life.  Their forms are vaporous and they can alter
their size and shape to allow for easy passage frough tiny openings, grates,
and even pourous stone.  Regardless of the type of dragon it was in life,
Wraith Dragons are always dark and shadowy in form, with luminous red 
eyes.  

COMBAT
        Wraith Dragons attack with the basic claw/claw/bite routine as
regular dragons.  In addition, each hit drains one life level from its  
victim.  A victim drain of all life energy, will become a Juju zombie  
under the control of the Wraith Dragon (as per the magic user ENERGY
DRAIN spell).  Its breath weapon is a freezing blast of cold that can 
freeze an adventurer solid, leaving the body in perfect condition to raise 
as undead.  All Wraith dragons of 18 or more hit dice gain the ability
to use mage spells, and at 25 HD, they gain clerical spells.  If 
a Spellcasting Dragon dies, it becomes a 16 HD Wraith Dragon with all of 
its former magical knowlage intact.

SPELL PROGRESSION
        When a Wraith Dragon reaches 18 HD, it gains a mage level (this 
is in addition to the spell ability the Wraith Dragon already possessed).  
Each additional HD, the Wraith Dragon gains another mage level.  At 25 HD, 
the Wraith Dragon gains a cleric level (in addition to any it may have had
in life) and it gains a cleric level per HD in a way that is similar to
mage level increases.  Spell progression is similar to that of player
characters, except that they get no bonus cleric spells for high wisdom
scores.

BEHAVIOR AND OTHER SPECIAL ABILITIES
        Dragon cults exist in nearly all worlds.  Often these clerics raise
undead dragons to do their bidding.  Dracoliches, death dragons, and other
undead horrors infect the Realms, Krynn, Oreth, and other places.  Once
in a while, an evil individual will use a diferent ritual to bring forth
a non-corporal dragon spirit of great evil.  A Wraith dragon will only work
with its summener for a short time, before slaying him or her.
Regardless of the type of dragon summoned, it will always start with 16
hit dice.  The Wraith Dragon gains all physical abilities of its new
form, but retians all of its mental abilities (INT WIS, and spells).
Unlike most undead, including Dracoliches, Wraith Dragons begin to
increase in power in a way similar to other characters, by performing
evil deads.  As time goes on, it will learn new spells (or gain spell-  
casting ability if it couldn't cast spells in life).  At 25 HD, a Wraith 
Dragon gains its most dangerous and terrifying ability, the ability to
bring corpses to (un)life at will.
        Before it reaches 25 HD, it will have a small army of
undead, but they always Juju zombies, created by draining victims
of their life forces.  At 25 HD, they gain the ability to raise corpses
at will.  The effect is seemingly unlimited.  All the Wraith Dragon has
to do is contact a grave site for a period of time, depending on the type
of undead the Wraith Dragon desires.  For souless undead (skeletons,
zombies, ect.) the effect may take place from the Wraith Dragon simply
walking over the desired graves.  For more powerful undead, the Wraith
Dragon may have to sit on a grave and concentrate for over an hour so
that its will can yank the soul of the victim back from an outer plane, 
to the gravesite (good souls get a saving throw vs. petrification 
using the stats that the character had in life, evil souls get no 
saving throws, and arrive at the grave site in half the time as a good 
souls, and neutral souls get saving throws, but arrive in half the time 
as good ones).  Wraith Dragons can also bring a body out of the 
ground as a soulless undead, and march it to its lair to later attempt soul
recall.  To make matters even more bleak, Wraith Dragons aren't limited  
to standard undead types, and can create any known undead, and even
make up its own undead types (adding powers to an undead corpse to
create a more powerful monster causes the undead to save vs. death, or
be disintegrated, freeing its soul to return to an outer planes, but on
success, the new undead is created).  The number of undead a Wraith
Dragon can control is virtually limitless (there are a few dead worlds
where Wraith Dragons held supreme power over vast numbers of undead,
and there's nothing left alive).  Unless killed, a Wraith Dragon can
overrun a world in a few short years.
        Though fearsome, they are VERY rare.  A typical world may only
have a couple of these horrors on it, and they're usually less than
25 HD.  They often aren't considered a real threat since even evil
dragons will attack them on sight and will often show a rare instance of
teamwork to dispose of these abominations.  Note that a high level
Wraith Dragon (25+ HD) tends to be a unique creature on a world, since
two high level Wraith Dragons will ether fight to the death, or one of
them will leave the world (they can move through wildspace and the
phlogestin at will).
        Wraith Dragons often take over a world using the following
stratagy.  First, they build up strength, often with the help of the
evil cleric or mage that brought it into the world.  When it reaches
about 18 or 19 hit dice, and built up a small contingnent of Juju
zombies, then it slays its former master and makes him or her undead.
Then it lays somewhat low for a while, occasionally killing people
to make more zombies for its army.  When it reaches 25 HD, and gains
the power to create undead at will, it will raid cemeteries at night
to raise corpses.  How it goes about this is determined by the amount
of knowledge the Wraith Dragon perceives that the population has of
Wraith Dragons (if the Wraith Dragon knows that the people are watching
for Wraith Dragons, it will raid grave sites cautiously by raising
only a few corpses in a cemetery, but if it feels that the people are
ignorant, then it will plunder whole regions for corpses).  During
this time, the Wraith Dragon will tend to live in an isolated area
as it consolidates power, leaving only to perform some night raids for
corpses and possible treasure.  When it reaches about 35 to 40 HD, then
it begins to invade with its army of undead.  It will also taunt
adventuring parties (often personally) to attempt to force them to give
up any quests that involve the Wraith Dragon.  Its invasions are
often slow paced, so it and its army can render the area uninhabitable
before moving on.  Slowly, but surely, over the period of a decade or
so, the Wraith Dragon and its undead army will divide, conquer, and
kill, the world.  Once the world is destroyed, then evil dieties move
in and create a power base on the prime material plane.
        
PROTECTING THE DEAD
        Bodies can be protected from Wraith Dragons by performing any 
of the following:
1.  A body can be embalmed in a mixture containing holy water.  This 
    doesn't prevent the corpse from being raised, but the resulting
    undead will take 1d8 points of damage per round until it dies.
2.  Using sanctified earth and wards vs. evil on or around the grave
    site.  This won't prevent the Wraith Dragon from raising the corpse,
    but the wraith dragon takes 1d4 points of damage per round on such
    a holy site.  This repells most Wraith Dragons, but higher level
    Wraith Dragons may still enter the site, (though they still suffer
    damage), and they leave before they get too badly hurt.
3.  The best way, is to destroy the body through disintegration or total
    cremation.  A Wraith Dragon cannot animate ashes.
4.  Some complex cleric rituals may also protect a corpse, but a persistant
    Wraith Dragon can often, still, animate the corpse.

DESIGNER NOTES
1.  Wraith Dragons should NOT be used in ramdom encounters, even
    low level (16 HD) ones.  In a whole game world, there should only
    be a handful of these monsters.
2.  Do not use in low level games (less than 8th level characters) 
    except for maybe as an optional encounter (like the beholder horde 
    in Curse of the Azure Bonds).
3.  Encounters of Wraith Dragons of less then 25th level should include
    a number of Juju zombies.
4.  Higher level Wraith Dragons should include ever increasing numbers
    of undead.  Higher level Wraith Dragons should have more powerful
    undead guards (sort of elite troops).  Often Dracolich varients are
    favorate guards (try fire breathing ones with paralyze gazes and fire
    touch attacks, like the ones in Curse of the Azure Bonds).
5.  This is the perfect way to have a campaign with a lot of undead.  
6.  A maxed out party of 40th level characters would have a very tough
    time fighting a solo 40th hit dice Wraith Dragon.  This doesn't
    include the undead army that would also be present.
