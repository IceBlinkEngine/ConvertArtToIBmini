Descriptions:

Bombardier: Usually found above ground in wooded areas. Carrion eater. AD&D stats give it 	                        	      50% chance per combat round of spraying 8'x8'x8' cloud of reddish acid vapor    
                  from it's abdomen. I gave it Dragon Acid to simulate this. It attacks with  it's  	          		      mandibles, as well. Approx. 4' long...

Fire          : Found above and below ground, almost anywhere. It has no fire attacks despite 
                 it's name. Two glands above their eyes and back of abdomens give off a red  glow.
                The light is a 'cold' light and prized by many. They are 2 1/2' long, although the icon
                 is not to scale. They attack with powerful mandibles.

Rhinoceros: Lives in jungles.Eats fruits and vegetables, but crushes anything that gets in it's          	      way. The shells are prized for thier iridescent carapaces. They total 12' feet in length, 
	      with a 6' horn. They attack with mandibles and the horn. I gave them 1/2 damage to 
	      cutting weapons due to the hardness of thier shells.

Stag	    : Found in woodlands. They are fond of grains and most crops, so they may be found   
                  raiding cultivated areas. They do eat carrion, so livestock is at risk, as well. They are 
                  10' long with 8' twins horns. They attack with mandibles and horns. They have 1/2 
                  damage to cutting weapons due to hard carapace.

Water     : These are found in and on fresh water less than 30 feet deep. They are voracious, 
                and will prey on any slow animal. Slow on land, but fast in water. Sometimes attack 
                small boats. They  are air breathers but can stay underwater for long times by catching 
                air under thier wings. They are 6' long and attack with mandibles. I gave them 1/2 
                damage tocutting and blunt weapons since they will most likely be encountered in an 
                aquatic setting. They are also vulnerable to fire, if on land.
