HANSART.ZIP
By hans

        Here are all the icons I used in my 'hanspcs.zip' Cbody  
        (c_hans1.pcx to c_hans49.pcx).  They are a mixture of 
        originals along with many heavily reworked SSI icons.  

        For your convenience, I've also included a screen-cap of 
        the player-character icon sheet (icon_map.pcx) for you 
        to refer to in finding a particular favorite.  

        You can use them as they are, or make any changes you 
        like --I won't mind!
