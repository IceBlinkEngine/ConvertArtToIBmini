           likely, UA SHELL
Type:      Freely distributed

After creating my first "hanspcs" Cbody, with which I planned to play 
many a mod using my own characters, --it suddenly dawned on me that I 
had neglected to include icons for many of my favorite Paladins!  So, 
I've taken another break from my "Asian" efforts to remedy the problem.  
Here's my new, general-fantasy Cbody with all of the new icons that I 
used to create it, as well as several other combat icons that had been 
collecting on my hard drive.

The zip contains:

33 combat icons in .pcx format, and 1 Cboby.tlb with an Icon_map.


WARNING:  If you decide to use the Cbody.tlb file outside of UA SHELL 
(or in a manner other than that prescribed for UA SHELL users), PLEASE 
make a back-up copy of your original Cbody.tlb file located in Disk 3 
of UA.  You can then replace the one in your Disk 3 folder with my  
enclosed Cbody.tlb (which will give you 49 new player icons to choose 
from) --and if you don't like the new set, you'll still have your 
original Cbody file to swap back again.  
 

Please feel free to use any of these icons any UA way you like, and 
make any changes you like.
