MODERN2.ZIP:  This collection contains 27 icons and 2 related pics for
use with modern (or maybe scifi) adventures.  Most of these are
obviously retouched art done by others.  The rest are retouched from
others' work as well -- for example, the G.I.'s are all based on an
archer icon.

"Soldiers":  All of these are soldiers in green army fatigues.  Some of
 them look kinda 1970's.  The first three make good Russians.  All of
 them do well as Americans, and #4 could pass for Jamaican.

"Pan-Africans":  Done for the mod "Panafrican Glory", which I might finish
 one of these days (maybe).  Most are based on drow icons, and they range
 in skin color from jet black to milk chocolate to help represent the
 diversity of peoples in the (fictitious) Pan-African Republic.  There
 are some pictures that work well as Panafrican soldiers in armor in
 the Azure Bonds picture set as well.
