Here's the official (and complete!) Buck Rogers: Matrix Cubed art set! It has
every icon (except 1), every sprite, every backdrop (except 3), every pic,
every map, and every bigpic! The totals are:

Backdrops:    14
Bigpics:      5
Combat Icons: 80
Maps:         2
Pics:         44
Sprites:      16
--------------------
Total (gulp): 161 (!)

This has got to be among the largest art collections ever uploaded!


Backdrops:
I must apologize, as I was unable to get three backdrops. They were: The
Lowlander Caves, the Lowlander Huts, and a Red tech backdrop that was used 
only once--in a very small room, no less!

Bigpics:

b_llvill pcx        The ruined Lowlander village.
b_sidatk pcx        Sid Refuge attacking at the end!
b_sunkng pcx        The Sun King's Conference


Combat Icons:
Got 'em all. No descriptions, though....Sorry, too many of 'em! Where I could,
I got the original "Action" pose--but most of them have "Action" poses that I
had to manually make. (Sorry again....) They're not bad, most of 'em, but they
aren't the true BR poses.....All of the PC Icons are included, and all of them
have their original "Action" poses. There are a lot of other icons that, with
some recoloring, would be *perfect* for PC icon files.

Whoops! There is *one* icon I left out. I left out the Jovian Dragon icon. You
won't miss it, though, because it was a very minor recolor of the Dracolisk
icon that is already a default monster icon in UA. So, if you want a Jovian
Dragon (why would you?) then you can use the Dracolisk icon from UA.
