These are icons for characters appropiate to TSR's Masque of the Red
Death setting, which is an expansion on Ravenloft. Masque of the Red
Death is a setting for gothic horror adventures set in the real world's
late nineteenth century. Obviously, icons for such a setting have
hitherto been few and far between. I hope this set inspires someone
out there to do a Masque of the Red Death mod - but if not, you may
find some of the icons here useful as swashbucklers in a more generic
fantasy setting.

C_FENCR*.PCX    icons of fencers and duellists
C_SOLDR*.PCX    icons of cavalrymen and riflemen
C_SCOUT*.PCX    icons of explorers and rangers
C_ROGUE*.PCX    icons of shady characters with revolvers
C_PROF*.PCX     icons of older men with guns
