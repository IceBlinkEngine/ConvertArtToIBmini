New Buck Rogers Icons

These icons are taken from PCC JohnR's Buck Rogers icons that he
captured from Matrix Cubed. These are all the PC icons, recolored
and changed to, well, look better. Unfortunately, I am not very
familiar with the Buck Rogers universe, so there's a good chance
I changed something that shouldn't have been changed. :)

If you want to see what the originals look like (or get your hands
on a bunch of great Buck Rogers images from Matrix Cubed) download
PCC JohnR's file, brog_all.zip

I won't list all the icons here... basically, it boils down to:

1 person armed with a knife
7 people armed with swords
9 people armed with laser pistols
9 people armed with laser rifles
1 person armed with laser cross bow
3 people armed with rocket launchers
3 people punching
2 people kicking



Enjoy!
