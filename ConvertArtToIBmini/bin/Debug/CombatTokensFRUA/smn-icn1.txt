[simoN]'s silly icon retouches
==============================

ok... rooting around in my huge icon stash i stumbled across
  a few of my edits which weren't too bad and might be useful
  to some of you... as such i'm presenting them here...

these are all edits... not really very original... but unique
  enough to warrant the upload... and not so bad to look at...

the archive contains:

	c_ancala.pcx	- HUGE icon of "Ancalagon the Black" of
			  J.R.R. Tolkien fame (re: Silmarillion).
			  adapted from SSI's original "FreezeFire"
			  icon.
	c_death.pcx	- Death of Sandman comic book fame.
			  Adapted from DETHGRL.PCX.
	c_octops.pcx	- an octopus.  recolored and fixed (no
			  pointy squid-head) to look like one.
	c_sphin1.pcx	- an andro-sphinx.  added wings and fixed
			  the colorization a little.

hope you like 'em...
