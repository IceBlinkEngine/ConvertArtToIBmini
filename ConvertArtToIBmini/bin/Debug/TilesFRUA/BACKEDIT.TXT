BACKEDIT - v1.0 UA Backdrop Importer (PCX)

OVERVIEW

As many of you have noticed by now, there is already a utility out that
allows you to edit backdrops.  Unfortunately, it only works for LBM graphics,
and PCX is the more accessible and popular of the two styles of graphics UA
accepts.  This utility allows you to import a PCX as a backdrop.  The
backdrops cannot color-cycle, but you ARE allowed some palette slot changes.
In fact, you are allowed to use the same slots the LBM version did.

I have included a PCX version of the "draw background" template for your use,
as well as three samples culled out from the many backdrops uploaded to AOL
over the last 2 years.  It is VERY likely that PCC JohnR did all three of
them, since he is responsible for about 90% of the 'drops currently out
there.  They were converted from LBM by the VPIC program.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE

Make sure BACKEDIT.EXE is in your main FRUA directory, or set up to run from
Kaviyd's UASHELL.  Otherwise, it won't work.

The format for the command line is:

BACKEDIT <filename> <slot#>

where <filename> is the full name of the PCX file you want to import, and
<slot#> is a value between 1 and 19.  The slot numbers correspond to the
same slots the LBM utility used.  If you missed either argument, you will be
prompted for the missing information.

The backdrops cannot be made to color-cycle, and the palette slots reserved
for backdrops are: 144-175.  The same ones the LBM editor allowed.

FEEDBACK

I don't expect much to go wrong with this program, nor is it so exciting
that I plan future versions and autograph signings.  Nonetheless, if you
want to comment on it, send E-mail to jgb4907@aol.com.
