these are wall replacements for the brick wallset.  that i have used for my castle in my mod i'm working on.  i would suggest using wall copy to  copy the brickset over something you don't wish to use.like the coral or adobe.
included is two screen captures that show the order they should be in.
 i hope you enjoy these. =)

i used wallcopy to copy the bricks over the coral wallsets then imported my battlments wallset into these two wall sets.

refer to example1.pcx this will show that the two battlment walls are put into on wallset the other  W_GRATE1.PCX IS OPTIONAL  and would be imported into a second brickset in the second slot 
as seen in example.pcx  this will allow you to use all the bricks battlements and have a gate to.

i hope this helps  explain
being my new version of battlements that are meant to look like they have more depth  or  three dimensional if you will..
if you want let me know what you think
