CAVEB.ZIP:  New walls for use with UAShell and the wall editor.  These
replace the "Coral B" set -- I call them "Cave B" because they augment
the Cave set.  I didn't really draw any of the pieces that make up the
set, I just put them together so they look nice.  The cave walls are
from the original FRUA cave wall set, shrunk slightly to fit in the
Coral B slot.  The chest I took from a pic of a chest done as part of
a "traps" set.  The niche is from SSI's Dungeon Hack.  The fungus is
what's left of the Coral set after recoloring it.
