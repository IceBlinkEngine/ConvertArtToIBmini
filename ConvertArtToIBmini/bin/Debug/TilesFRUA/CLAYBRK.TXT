NAME:  CLAYBRK.ZIP
DESC:  Clay Brick Wall Set & Backdrop
AUTHOR: D Rapp

The walls were adapted from a set by Rob.  I did some minor color changes,
adapted them to the firebrick set and added a firepit in slot 4.  Color
cycling is #64, 4 colors, 11 speed.

The backdrop (bg_clayb.pcx) is original, using the same colors that are in
the wall set.
