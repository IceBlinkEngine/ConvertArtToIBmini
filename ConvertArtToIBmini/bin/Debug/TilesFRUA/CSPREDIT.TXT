CSPREDIT - v1.0 Combat Sprite Editor

OVERVIEW

This program allows the user to import combat graphics, like arrows, fire
effects, etc.  It is easy to use.  Use your favorite paint program on
CSPR.PCX to draw the graphics, re-name it with some other name, and import
it by typing:  CSPREDIT <filename>, where filename is the name you gave the
file.  The entire set of combat graphics will immediately be switched in.

LIMITATIONS

The biggest limitation is that YOU CANNOT CHANGE THE PALETTE when editing
your combat sprites.  While the COMSPR.TLB file has palette info in it,
UA apparently ignores it.  You'll have to make do with the colors that
CSPR.PCX has in its palette.  Certain colors in the palette may change
with differing wilderness maps and combat walls, so not all colors should
be considered reliable.  Colors 64-95 should be safe, since these are the
colors COMSPR.TLB should allow changes in.  I think SSI was just careless
and did not bother to properly update their palettes for everything, or this
thing would be a lot more versatile.  Colors that I KNOW are UNSAFE are
colors 32-63, since the wilderness maps use these colors.

I included a sample set of combat art in CSPR1.PCX, which has a re-colored
fireball effect replacing the arrows.  Enjoy!
