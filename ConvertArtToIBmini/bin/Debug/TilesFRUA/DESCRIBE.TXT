NEW SNOW WALLS AND WATER WILDERNESS v2

Here is a nice offering from WodahsEht1:

It is my new SNOW WALL and WATER COMBAT set.  It includes:

W_SNOW0-4.PCX           A simple color-modification from adobe.  To be used
                        with WALLEDIT.  This is to go over the adobe wallset.

WILDWATR.PCX            An overwater view of a river.  Contains floating logs,
                        jagged rocks, and some floating moss.  To be used with
                        WILD and (optionally) GROWWILD.

WILDOCEN.PCX            An overwater view of an ocean.  Contains lots of 
                        seaweed.

In case you do not have WILD and/or WALLEDIT, these files are USELESS to you.
I suggest you download these great utilities, available on AOL and the 'Net.

Thanx for downloading these.  Be expecting more from me in the future...

To use, consult your WILD and WALLEDIT manuals.

NOTE:  The last version's text was messed up...  That is all that is new in 
this one.
