HALLS OF DESPAIR

By Ghaaroth

This is theme collection of 4 wallsets, all containing faces of doomed,
tortured entities inside their cold stone surfaces. 2 of them are brand new,
2 were uploaded before, but now are edited specially for this theme pack.

Contents:

DEATH - Hall of Death, for Adobe wall slot. Previously uploaded as
                 "Wall of skulls". For this edition I improved secondary
                 slot 1, with crumbled wall. Other secondary slots have
                 new palette, comparing to original Adobe.
DEMONS - Hall of Demons, for Wood-A wall slot. Previously uploaded as "Wall
                 of Souls". For this edition I switched from Rock-A slot of
                 first edition to Wood-A, to free space for new wallset and
                 to make Souls/Demons different from it. Secondary slots have
                 new palette, comparing to original Wood-A. Also there is
                 second variant for slot 1 (window) - besides original non-
                 transparent window with grey glass (w_demon1.pcx), I added
                 same window made transparent (w_demot1.pcx)
PAINS - Hall of Pains, for Rock-A wall slot. Made from cover picture of book
                 by H.P. Lovecraft. Palette is unchanged from original UA.
                 Slots 2 and 4 were slightly altered (pieces of original
                 stone framework removed), slots 1 and 3 were left completely
                 unchanged and thus are not included into pack.
SUFFER - Hall of Suffer, for Rock-B wall slot. Made from another part of that
                 cover, and is intended to be used together with Pains.
                 Palette is unchanged, slots 1, 2 and 4 are slightly
                 retouched, slot 3 is left intact.
