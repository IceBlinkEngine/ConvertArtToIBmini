DUNGEDIT :  v1.1 Combat Wall Art Import Utility

Do I need to tell you to back up your DUNGCOM.TLB file within your DISK2
subdirectory if you want some possibility of going back to the old walls?
If not, too late!  If so, well, now you know... I sincerely do not believe
this program will spindle, fold, and/or mutilate any part of your system,
but I must make you aware that I am not responsible if your system does
just that, even if my program somehow played a part in its demise.

This program allows you to alter the walls that get set up in a combat
situation.  Like Peter Kos' WILD utility, the walls are actually a series
of tiles.  These tiles will (hopefully!) fit together into walls when
assembled at the start of a UA combat.

This utility is very simple to use if you are used to my WALLEDIT program,
because the arguments all mean the same thing!  The only difference is that
this program has no "groups", so it does not use that parameter.  Just in
case you don't have (or have never used) WALLEDIT, this is the list of legal
command line arguments:

FILE= or F=     Indicates the filename of the PCX being imported.  As usual,
please include full path name and the PCX extension.

WALLSET= or W=  Indicates which combat wall set to replace.  Currently, there
are 5 legal wall sets, numbered 1 to 5.

CYCLE= or C=    Like the other walls, combat walls can also color cycle.  To
preserve file size, I only allow cycling in the sets that allowed cycling
before.  In this case, this means sets 3 and 5.  If your WALLSET argument is
something else, no cycling is allowed and this arg is ignored.  Oh yes, a
value of 1 means NO cycling, and 3 means cycling.

START= or S=    The first color index of the color cycle.

RUN= or R=      The number of colors in the cycle.  Generally, the more
colors that cycle, the smoother it looks (assuming proper color arrangment).

PERIOD= or P=   The speed of the cycle.  The lower the number, the faster the
cycle.  In this case, any value below 10 is insanely fast unless there are a
lot of colors in the cycle.  The current sets are more like 30.

As with WALLEDIT, if you forget any arguments, DUNGEDIT will ask you for
any information that it requires.

PREPARING YOUR GRAPHIC

To aid in your design efforts, I will describe how the color palette works in
a combat situation.  Slots 0-31 are global color slots that are defined in
FRAME.TLB and ALWAYS.TLB, and cannot be changed by this program.  You can
probably get away with using them, but expect to use what UA will give you
in this situation.

Slots 32-63 are safe to change with this program.  When designing your PCX,
try to place your entire range of wall colors in this range.

Slots 64-96 are shared by Combat Icons and Combat Sprite Graphics, and CAN be
used for wall graphics.  It is NOT a good idea to change these color slots
unless you want to change the appearance of every combat icon and combat
graphics in the game.  However, you CAN change these colors via DUNGEDIT.

Slots 97-255 are used almost exclusively by Combat Icons.  The same rules
apply as last paragraph, including the fact that DUNGEDIT can change these
colors if you're sure that's what you want to do...

NOTE:  There is NO transparent color in DUNGEDIT!  The walls are put up
FIRST when UA sets up a combat screen, so in a sense they ARE the background
for all the other effects.  This is analogous to Backdrops in 3D mode.

What this all means is that it is now possible to re-define the palette for
combat icons!  The problem is that old icons would no longer work unless
translated to the new color scheme.  This would mean that someone (read: I)
will have to write a program to convert existing icons to the new color
scheme.  If there is enough demand for such a program, I will write it.
A similar situation exists for combat sprite graphics.

I have included a sample wall set for you to play with.  It's basically the
Lava set re-colored blue for the "Mr. Freeze" effect.  It cycles.
Use these arguments:

DUNGEDIT F=DUNG.PCX W=5 C=3 S=59 R=5 P=20

With some careful work, you could probably make this thing look like you're
fighting in a blizzard (though the PC's and monsters being clearly visable
might spoil the effect somewhat).

CHANGES SINCE LAST VERSION:
v1.0 did not allow color cycling to be turned off.  This version (v1.1) does.

Some error checking was also added to hopefully keep the size of DUNGCOM.TLB
reasonable.

Sarlegant: For working out the original wall file structure, which is the
   basis for my knowledge of the rest of the files.
Peter Kos: For coming out with WILD and proving to me that a graphics editor
   was possible.

   at last.

See you next editor!
