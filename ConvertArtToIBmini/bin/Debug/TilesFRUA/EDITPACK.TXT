EDITPACK II - 11 UA Graphics Utilities

This is a collection of all the UA editing programs I have done to date.
These programs are generally easy to use and most can be run completely
from DOS command line with no further input (good if you want to put
graphics editing commands in a batch file, for instance).

This package contains the following programs:

        BACKEDIT - PCX Backdrop Import Utility
        CSPREDIT - Combat Sprite Import Utility
        DUNGEDIT - Dungeon Combat Art Import Utility
        ICONEDIT - PC Icon Import Utility
        IT_BATCH - Item String Editor
        TEXTEDIT - General CKIT.EXE Text Editor
        WALLEDIT - Wall Art Import Utility
        WALLREND - Wall Art Render Utility
        WILDEDIT - Wilderness Combat Art Import Utility
        WALLCOPY - Wall Art Slot Copy Utility
        RC_EDIT  - Race/Class Info Editor

If you have UASHELL, put all these files into the DOWNLOAD subdirectory,
then follow the UASHELL instructions for installing them.  If you don't
have UASHELL, copying all the files to the main UA directory should work.
You may want to stash the various art and text files somewhere else.

If you have any problems with any of these utilities, contact me at
