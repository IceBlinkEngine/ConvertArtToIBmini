JUST THOUGHT I'D DROP A LITTLE NOTE TO SAY A FEW THINGS
ABOUT THIS SET....
The ART HEREIN IS DONE FOR USE IN AN EGYPTIAN SETTING TYPE MODULE

ARE DESIGNED TO FIT OVER THE "BRICKS" SLOT.  WITH THAT SAID AND DONE..
HERE IS MY EGYPTIAN ARTWORK (SOME WAS BORROWED BY OTHERS JUST TO
MAKE THE SET MORE COMPLETE)
