More stuff...  They go over Adobe sets...

W_SNOW?.PCX    Wallsets with template info stored in them.  My original ones
uploaded eons ago should be completely replaced by these; they are much more
accurate.
DUNGSNOW.PCX   Dungeon combat art.  (slot 4)
WILDSNOW.PCX   These came with WILD (by Peter Kos).  They're his.
D_SNWDAY.PCX   Daytime backdrop.  (slot 16)
D_SNWNIT.PCX   Nighttime backdrop.  (slot 17)
D_INDSNW.PCX   Indoor backdrop.  (slot 7)

INSTALLATION:

You must have all/some of the following:

WALLEDIT  by James Blair.  Available at his site:
ftp://users.aol.com/JCB4907/
BACKEDIT  by James Blair.  Available at his site:
ftp://users.aol.com/JCB4907/
DUNGEDIT  by James Blair.  Available at his site:
ftp://users.aol.com/JCB4907/
WILD      by Peter Kos.  Available on AOL and at Caltech and Berkeley

To install these files:

From DOS (in the FRUA directory):

(Make sure you make backups!)

WALLS - 
type WALLEDIT F=ART\W_SNOW?.PCX (where ART is where the walls should be and
the ? represents each file (0-4)

BACKDROPS - 
type BACKEDIT F=ART\D_SNWDAY.PCX then answer the question provided with "16"
type BACKEDIT F=ART\D_SNWNIT.PCX then answer the question provided with "17"
type BACKEDIT F=ART\D_INDSNW.PCX then answer the question provided with "7"

DUNGEONS-
type DUNGEDIT F=ART\DUNGSNOW.PCX then answer the question with "4"

WILDERNESS-
this one is tricky:

1. Copy WILDSNOW.PCX and WILD.EXE to the DISK2 directory.
2. In the DISK2 directory, type WILD.
3. Select the WILDSNOW.PCX file.
4. Select the slot you want it in.
5. Go for it!

To make this all compatible with UATOOLS, simply copy the following files to
your .DSN directory:

DISK2\WILDCOM.TLB
DISK2\DUNGCOM.TLB
DISK2\BACK.TLB
DISK2\8X8DB.TLB

That's it!

**** UASHELL 2.00 (in beta on Kaviyd's ftpsite:  ftp://users.aol.com/kaviyd)
will help make the chore easier; I suggest picking up a copy. ****

FYI, These hacks are made for my convenience, but I assumed that the FRUA
public has wanted to "romp in the snow" for awhile, thus I decided to release
this (IMHO) incredibly useful set of graphics.  Most of them are simply major
template re-hauls of the adobe sets :).
