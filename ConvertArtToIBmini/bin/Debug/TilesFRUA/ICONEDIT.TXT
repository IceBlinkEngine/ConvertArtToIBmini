ICONEDIT - v1.2 PC Combat Icon Import Utility

OVERVIEW

Why write another PC icon editor?  If you used the other one, you KNOW why!
In order to replace an icon, you had to import it as a monster icon, somehow
locate what file you just wrote within your design directory, rename it, and
run the other utility.  Whew!  Did I get it all?

Well, this one's a LOT simpler.  It uses the same PCX files as you use to
import into the monster icon slots.  In fact, as long as it is a small icon,
ANY of your monster/elf/whatever icon art can be imported as a PC icon!

CHANGES SINCE LAST VERSION

All 49 slots are now legal and fully usable.  Many thanks to autrey@aol.com
for figuring out how those last 5 slots were done (actually, I found a better
way to do them, but his efforts made me look at the right place).

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE

There are 2 ways to use this program:  with command line arguments, and
without them.  With arguments, it is activated by typing at the DOS prompt:

ICONEDIT <PCX filename> <slot number>

Without the filename and slot number specified by the command line (ie: just
typing ICONEDIT), you will be prompted for the information.  The first
argument is always the filename; if you only feel like entering one argument,
please make it the filename (otherwise you'll feel a bit silly when the
program tells you it can't find a file called 22).

When entering the filename, make sure the full path and the .PCX extension
is included.  The slot number can be any value between 1 and 49.  For real!
They all work this time!

EXAMPLE

ICONEDIT C_ELF01.PCX 1

This places the icon in the file C_ELF01.PCX into slot 1.  If you had left
off the 1, the program would have asked you for a slot number.  If you left 
BOTH arguments out, the program asks for both filename and slot number.  If
you left out the filename, but included the 1, the program will kindly inform
you that it can't open a file called "1", because you probably don't have 
such a file.

LIMITATIONS

1. Put the program in your main FRUA directory.  I know it's cluttered up
with a bunch of other stuff, but it's the only place I know that all of you
will have.  If the program tells you it can't open the icon file, it is
because you have failed to do this.  

(UPDATE: if you have UASHELL already installed, put this file and the
others in this package into the DOWNLOAD subdirectory of UA, and run UASHELL.
Then select Utilities | Install.)

2. Be sure the filename you type in is a PCX graphic.  While it might be
interesting to see what this program does with a WordPerfect document, you
can be rest assured it won't be pretty...

PROBLEMS?  COMMENTS?

You can E-mail me at JGB4907@aol.com.  AOL has thoughtfully provided me an
FTP site at users.aol.com\jgb4907, so you can find my latest stuff there.
I must warn you that some of it's beta, so use at your own risk.
