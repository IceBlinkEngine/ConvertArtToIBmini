Wellmet, seeker of New Art!

Herein, you will find enclosed the following wallset:

w_stone0-4.pcx -- New fitted-stone walls (with open entry, door, writing)

* (w_mount0.pcx -- a test subject for... mountains?  I need feedback on this
                one so I can complete the wall -- thanks!)

* (b_mountd.lbm
* (b_mountn.lbm -- day and night backdrops with mountains that are set to
                match the test wall for w_mount0.pcx)

  Some of you may recognize the fitted-stone wall... taken from the Eye
of the Beholder series and recolored, fitted, and retouched!  Behold, the
power of Screenthief, Dpaint, and objectivity!  If it so pleases, I have
more pieces based on this set, including: unfitted peasant stone wall,
stone wall with wooden roof, mossy stone wall, climbing ivy stone wall,
and spell-shattered stone wall.
  As always, I welcome all feedback/comments -- 'tis the only way I can
help you get that special or specific art piece that you just cannot find...

  Look forward to the new wilderness set 2, including water-based walls (and
a bridge!) and the new ship set, which is a vertical wooden plank set that
includes a single post usable as ship mast or bridge support and, of course,
any applicable backgrounds.

  Until we meet again, enjoy!
