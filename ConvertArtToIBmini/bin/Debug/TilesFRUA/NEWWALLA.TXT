This archive contains a new wall set-a sewer wall covered with slimy green
plants!  It is intended to be placed over the "bricks" default set (#5).
The basic wall and the arch were captured from SSI's Treasures of the Savage
Frontier and the palettes were changed around a bit... The stairway and the doors
are simply the original "brick" items overlayed onto a new master wall, with the
palette adjusted accordingly... I hope you enjoy these!

TO USE:

Place the contents of the NEWWALLA.ZIP archive in your FRUA master directory...
type WALLEDIT at the dos prompt.  The program will ask you for the name of the
file you wish to import-enter W_Sewer0.pcx first, then repeat with W_Sewer1.pcx
and so on.  When the program asks you which set you wish to import these to, answer
5 (or, if you've copied the "bricks" template to another wallset, you can enter
the number of that wallset).  W_Sewer0.pcx goes in slot 0, W_Sewer1.pcx on slot 1,
and so on.
