RC_EDIT - UA Race/Class Editor v1.0

WARNING - Please be aware that this file tampers with the main UA executable,
CKIT.EXE, and can thus seriously mess up your game if you're not careful.
It is strongly advised that you either back up your CKIT.EXE file, or install
the UASHELL package (which creates its own backups when you install it).  I
am NOT to held responsible for any damage this program might cause, so
consider yourself warned.

OVERVIEW

RC_EDIT is intended to be a quick and easy way to do major race and class
editing without doing things a single value at a time like UGE would force
you to do.  Some of the functions have their own generator routines so you
can build a table without entering all of its values.  However, if you DO
want to enter all the values, you can.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE

1.  Place RC_EDIT.EXE in the main UA directory (where CKIT.EXE resides),
unless your current version of UASHELL supports RC_EDIT (in which case
you follow UASHELL's directions.

2.  Type RC_EDIT to start.  It takes no command arguments.

3.  Look at the main menu.  Enter some value between 1 and 13, or Q to quit.

4.  Some sort of display will show the current values dealing with the area
you just chose to edit.  To edit something, you enter a number in the
indicated range, or one of the letters in parentheses.  Two options to all
sub-menus are (S)ave and (Q)uit, activated by entering S or Q, respectively.

5.  After you edit something, you will see an updated display and a chance
to edit more stuff, save, or quit.  NOTE:  If you Quit before Saving, all
changes done since the last time you saw the main menu are LOST!  If you go
there again, you'll see the old values.  Please remember to Save any data
BEFORE returning to the main menu.  Unless you messed up royally and you
WANT the old data back, of course!

6.  As you might have noticed by now, Quit from a sub-menu kicks you back
out to the main menu.  From there you can edit some other category, or quit
for real.

LIMITATIONS OF USE

The only limitation that I am aware of is that this program does NOT bend
over backwards to make sure your data is valid.  If you give all Paladins
a special ability that crashes the machine, RC_EDIT will cheerfully let you
do it.  Similarly, there's nothing keeping you from giving something a THAC0
of 100 or 100 memorizable 9th level spells to 1st level Mages.  In short,
everything will be okay if you enter reasonable data.

If there are any problems, or there's some other race/class related thing
that I might have forgotten, please E-mail me at jgb4907@aol.com.  I will
determine if a fix or addition is possible (and feasible), and if so I
will release another version.

Enjoy!
