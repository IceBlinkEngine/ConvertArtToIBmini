Using WALLREND with Paint Shop Pro for Nice-looking Walls

Definitions:
  "w_ file" - Wall PCX used by WALLEDIT, usually called w_name#.pcx.
  "wt_ file" - A standard name I've come up with to refer to the
56x56 pcx file used by WALLREND (wt_name#.pcx).

For best results, draw the pic in the front-close slot of the wall
template (the w_ file) as if you were going to draw all the walls
yourself, then re-size it to 56x56 and put into its own file (the
wt_ file).  It will probably look funny, but WALLREND will then do
things the way you intended (ie: your half-height wall won't be cut
in half again when it tries to put it into a small slot).

In Paint Shop Pro, this would be:

1.  Select close-front image from w_ file (not including frame).
2.  Ctrl-C to copy it.
3.  Create a new 56x56 image.  Ctrl-A to select all.
4.  "Paste into selection".
5.  Be sure the palette of the 56x56 looks okay (save pal from old
    and load into 56x56 if necessary).
6.  Save the 56x56 as a 256-color PCX (give it a wt_ name).
7.  Run WALLREND with wt_ file as first argument and w_ file as last
    argument.
8.  The w_ file will be over-written by the finished walls.  Touch
    up as needed.

This version of WALLREND produces much better images than the old
version, because it uses double-precision numbers when determining
what pixel on the 56x56 it should be using for each pixel of the
w_file... the old version used integers (yuk!).

BTW, there's nothing keeping you from doing the 56x56 in full
256-color glory, running WALLREND, then reducing the colors in the
w_ file.  Keep the last color transparent, though.

If you cut-and-paste your 5 intended 56x56 walls to a single file,
you can work out a palette that works with all of them ... this
means you'd color-reduce first, then apply WALLREND (the opposite
of the last paragraph).  Then you can split them back up and be
assured they share the same palette.

To properly reduce colors to WALLEDIT compatibility in Paint Shop Pro:

1.  Load w_ or wt_ file (depending on when you decide to reduce),
    choose Colors/Reduce Color Depth/X Colors.
2.  Reduce to 38 colors (37 if no transparent color).
3.  Save the palette; remember the file name you gave it.
4.  Start up a text editor, and open the palette file.
5.  Cut 32 rows of triple-zeroes from end of palette and paste right
    after the line with the single 256 value.  If you used the
    transparent color, cut the last non-zero row and paste it to
    the end.
6.  Go back to Paint Shop Pro, select your pic again, and Load
    Palette.
7.  Save your pic.  It shouldn't look any different than before you
    loaded the palette, but now it is WALLEDIT-legal.  A bit of
    trouble, but not as much as changing 37-38 slots by hand...
