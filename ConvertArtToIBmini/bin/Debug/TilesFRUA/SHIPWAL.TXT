Nautical Themed Walls for FRUA!

WARNING: YOU NEED TO PURCHASE SSI's Forgotten Realms
UNILIMITED ADVENTURES to use this art.

Okay, here are yet more new walls, hot off the presses
(literally!).  I'm presently working on a nautically
themed mod, and the included artwork is some of the
early results.

W_ADBRK0-4.PCX This wall set fits in the "Brick"
set.  It's my attempt to reproduce the "Clay brick"
style archetecture that you find in some parts of
the Carribean.

BG_SHIPD.PCX & BG_SHIPN.PCX - Day an night backgrounds
for the deck of a ship at sea.  I modified these
from the "Wooden Floor" backgrounds which you can find
on the upload boards-- Thanks to the artists, whose
names escapes me. :(

W_SHipr1.pcx - This is the railing of a ship at sea,
for use with the backgrouds above.  The effect is quite
good, and it could probably also be used for a dock.

Thanks and good luck!
