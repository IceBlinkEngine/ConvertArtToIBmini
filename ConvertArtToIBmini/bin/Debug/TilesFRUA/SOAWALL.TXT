WALLS for FRUA!

by Rob Kendzie (WOLFSNAP@AOL.COM)


Here we have a few wall sets, some of which have you may
have seen in "Sword of Archania".  An altar, a library
set, and a new set - a coastline!! :)

First off:  W_altar3 is designed to replace the wooden
door in the "Brick" set. (slot #3)

Next: THe "library" set from "Sword of Archania".  Okay,
It's not the greatest, and the "Table" slot isn't too
great, but overall it gets the point across.

It's designed to replace the "Coral A" slots. (0-4)

Finally, a wall labelled "W_Shor0".  This wall fits into
slot 0 of "Trees A" and when used properly will provide
you with a coastline.  Use it with the "Outdoor Grass"
backdrop and you have an ocean!  I'm looking for ways to
improve this, so if anyone has any ideas, please let me
know.

Comments are always appreciated. :)
