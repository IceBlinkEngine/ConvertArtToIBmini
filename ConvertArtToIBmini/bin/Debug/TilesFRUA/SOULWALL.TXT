WALL OF TRAPPED SOULS

Original artwork was taken from background of website of S.A.T.A.N. guild
messageboard in Lords of Empyria game. With Paint Shop Pro I made a primary
wallset with these demonic twisted faces, carved in stone. It worked well
with Rock-A palette, so this file - w_faces0.pcx - should be placed with
Walledit on slot 0 (well, leftmost one) of Rock-A wallset. Other files
are secondary elements of original wallset (gate, ladder, door) slightly
altered for use with my primary wall (brick frame removed from last 2
elements, and gate is made little smaller). 4th slot (3, counting from zero)
of original wallset was left completely unchanged, so i didnt included it.
Combine this with original lava wallset, and you will get ultimate walls of
Hell!

Thanks to Primedemon and SATAN guild for making original demonic faces
available to me..:)

Enjoy!
And dump aol.
