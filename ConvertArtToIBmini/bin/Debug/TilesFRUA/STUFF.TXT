Well, here they are.  ANOTHER batch of artwork.

TO USE (Walls and backdrops, in case you don't know how)

-Walls-

1.Type walledit (from the FRUA main directory)

2.The program will prompt you to tell it where the wall file you wish to 
import is located (e.g. C:\art\w_body1.pcx).

3.The computer will ask which wall slot you wish to place this in.  Answer 9.

4.Now it will ask which slot you wish to fill.  W_body1.pcx goes in slot 1, 
w_body2.pcx in slot 2, and w_body3.pcx in slot 3.  DO NOT IMPORT WALL FILES
INTO ANY SLOT OTHER THAN THOSE GIVEN, AS IT WILL NOT IMPORT CORRECTLY AND 
SCREW UP YOUR WALL FILE!

-Backdrops-

1.Type backedit (from the FRUA main directory) 

2.The program will prompt you to tell it where the backdrop file you wish to 
import is located (e.g. C:\art\b_body.pcx).

3.The computer will now ask which slot you want to fill.  It doesn't 
particularly matter, but I would advise you to cover up one of the more 
"specialized" backdrops, i.e. swamp, lava, or dark coral.


C_MOTH.PCX            Giant Moth icon            
C_CNTR.PCX            Centaur icon
W_BODY?.PCX           Walls from Moander's body in POD.  Intended to go over
                      wasteland set.
B_BODY.PCX            Backdrop from Moander's body.

Enjoy!
