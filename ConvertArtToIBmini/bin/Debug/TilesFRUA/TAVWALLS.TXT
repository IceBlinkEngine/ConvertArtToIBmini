Salutations once again fellow UA'ers.

It tis one of everyones favorite artist and alterers bringin' to ya yet another piece of fine
art for ya'll! (Not to mention poor slang and missing my spell-checker, so bare with me.)

In this, my second art download for UA, I have included both what I think is need in wall
art as well as something that has yet to be made. (I think it has not been made.)

In case you missed it by the way, these are tavern walls. (Best used as, that is.)

In this .ZIP file you will find the following......


Tavwalls.TXT: Maybe I'm a bit crazy, but I'll bet good money you're reading it right now.:)

W_TVBRK0.pcx: This is a clear wood table. But there are two problems with this wall...
1): There are no side views of this table, so if you turn to the side when facing it...POOF!
its gone. My recommendation on fixing this, make an area in the wall and then place
this in the middle of that space...like a booth.
2): If you install this into your UA, the edges of the table will show up behind all but the
second set of walls in the same group. Recommendation: Either use WALLCOPY to copy the wall frame to another frame after you put this wall in or just use this wall alone.

W_TVBRK1.pcx: What tavern would be complete without swinging doors? This is a pair
of swinging doors I made for those who want an inn or tavern to have a saloon like
entrance, have a kitchen entryway, or entrance to a private room in the tavern.


AH! Look! Found my spell-checker! I'll just leave the rest as-is and use this now.


W_TVBRK2.pcx: This is no stairway to heaven, but it could be to an upstairs tavern or
even go to a shop. And with a sign hanging from the top you can know where it goes.

W_TVBRK3.pcx: I took that strange looking door with the ring doorknob and made it
into either a doorway you can push open, or maybe as a cabinet for food or whatever.

W_TVBRK4.pcx: Have you ever tried to find someones room and have to search around
the house to find it? Or maybe you wanted to search everywhere BEFORE you entered
that special room? Well, now we have that problem solved. (At least somewhat.) This
could be used for anything really. Use it to find one "L. Croft" or "Room #13", maybe as
the sign to a shop...whatever. If you have a reason to mark a door as something......

W_BRKWN0.pcx: How many times have you entered an inn or bar or whatever and
thought. "Where the H*** are the windows?" while looking around? Well try this for size!
This is really just a window frame with white streaks in the glass. (Mostly to make it
look either old and somewhat dirty or gleaming in the light...maybe both.)

W_CBKWN0.pcx: Same as above (W_BRKWN0.pcx) except without the streaks in
case you're looking for something cleaner or the streaks are just annoying to you.

(Note: Both these windows suffer the same problem with showing up behind doors that
the wooden table (W_TVBRK0.pcx) does. So you may want to follow the same advise
about WALLCOPY from W_TVBRK0.pcx for this one too. On the bright side, you can
turn to the side and they will still be there.)

I also forgot to add these all go over the "Brick" wallset. The #'s at the end tell where.

If anything, these are my first try at non-altered-non-coverted kinds of art. If they look a
little fake to you, don't worry, I'm sure someone like Dika or someone with good skills
will either make there own...or better mine. ( :> )

If you have any Questions, Comments, Ideas or Worship (The latters nice.) send them
to:

          EMPIRE B@AOL.COM


One final note: In case you did not know, this is best used with a hack called
"WALL IMPORT UTILITY V.2.00" by JGB4907@aol.com or any other wall importer.

           Untill next time

                 Das EMP.


OH! And also check out my other art download "FF2 Airships" and my soon-to-be
finished first adventurer for UA "Escape from Zanzers Dungeon" coming soon. (I hope)
