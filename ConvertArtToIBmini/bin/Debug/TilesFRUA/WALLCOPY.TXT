WALLCOPY - v1.0 Wall Copy Utility

One of the most annoying limitations of the UA wall editor is the fact that
you cannot change the size or color cycling statistics of the various walls.
This program partially redresses this problem by allowing you to copy entire
wallsets from one slot to another.  The new slot ends up with the same image
data, the same size data, and even the same color cycling data as the
wallset you decided to copy.

HOW TO USE

It's very simple.  Run WALLCOPY from your main FRUA directory, and choose the
slot numbers you want to copy to and from.  You even get to see a listing of
the original slot names so you can keep track of what's what.  After the
program is over, you have a wall file in your FRUA directory that matches the
name of one of your actual wall files.  In order to copy this file over to
where the "official" wall files are, enter the DOS command:

COPY 8X8DB.TLB DISK2
or
COPY 8X8DC.TLB DISK2

depending on which file just got created.  This is a security measure that
I will impose until I am sure this thing works;  later versions may do the
copy without your help.

KNOWN BUGS

I haven't figured out why yet, but there's 1 extra byte at the end of each
wall file.  Since UA appears to totally ignore it, I don't consider it a
problem.

WALLEDIT aggressively forces sets that did not originally color-cycle to
turn color cycling off.  This includes any walls that now DO color-cycle
due to WALLCOPY's interference.  Sooo, to work around this, don't use
WALLEDIT to edit any wall set that originally didn't color-cycle and does
now.  If you want a lot of color-cycling sets, copy the current color-cycle
sets to other slots, and edit the slots that ORIGINALLY color-cycled (since
WALLEDIT allows these to be turned off and on at will).  At least until I
get another edition of WALLEDIT done...
