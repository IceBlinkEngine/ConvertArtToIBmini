WALLREND - v2.0 Wall Rendering Utility

OVERVIEW

This utility takes a 56x56 PCX of a "flat" wall, and tries to render it into
a WALLEDIT-compatible PCX file.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE

This program must be placed in the main UA directory for it to work.  Once
Kaviyd integrates it into UASHELL, it may also reside in the PROGRAMS
subdirectory.

The program uses 4 command line arguments: any missing values will be
prompted for when the program is run, but be aware that it will expect the
arguments to be in order (ie: if you leave some off, leave the LAST ones off).

WALLREND <input PCX> <wallset num> <group num> <output PCX>

The <input PCX> must be a 56x56 frontal wall graphic.  No other size will
work (ie: don't try to process a full 320x200), and it doesn't care what
its palette is (WALLEDIT will care, though!).  Color 255 (transparent) is
a perfectly valid color.

The wallset and group num are the same values that you will plan to use when
you run WALLEDIT.  These values determine how big the walls are (the size
values are pulled straight out of the wall files).

The <output PCX> will be created when you run the program.  It will look
like a WALLEDIT template, hopefully because it IS a WALLEDIT template.

A couple of sample wall tempates are included for you to test.  Both appear
to work very well, especially with the larger wall groups.

LIMITATIONS/CAVEATS

On ten-wall groups, the first map is placed on both sides of the second map.
Because of this, there is no sensible way to render the first map.  So I
put a "fudge factor" in there that may make the first map look inapproprate.
It is strongly advised that you touch-up this first map to make it look
better (there is really nothing I can do about this...).

Just about all of the limitations of the first version have been addressed.
You may want to touch-up the walls after they have been rendered, especially
if your walls are not intended to be flat.

Enjoy!
