New Wall Set
Autumn Leaves -- originally intended to be a burning forest, but I couldn't
                 make it cycle correctly. Intented to replace Trees A (11).
Red Marble --    A companion to PCCJohnR's Red Marble backdrop on AOL.
                 Replaces Marble (10).

To use, consult the documentation that came with the WallEdit package.
If you don't have WallEdit, GET IT!!! You need it to use these wall sets!
Happy FRUAing!
