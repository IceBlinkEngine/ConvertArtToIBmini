Included are wall sets, including some with matching backgrounds.
I hope you find them useful.

CLAYBRICK - Wall Set & Backdrop  
-------------------------------
These walls were adapted from a set by Rob.  I did some minor color changes, 
adapted them to the firebrick set and added a firepit in slot 4.  Color 
cycling is #64, 4 colors, 11 speed.

   * w_clayb1.pcx  --  Replaces firebrick slot 1
   * w_clayb2.pcx  --  Replaces firebrick slot 2
   * w_clayb3.pcx  --  Replaces firebrick slot 3
   * w_clayb4.pcx  --  Replaces firebrick slot 4

The backdrop is original, using the same colors that are in the wall set.

WOODA - 2 Wall changes
----------------------
These are changes made to the existing wallset WOODA.  
   * w_woodA1.PCX -- Replaces woodA slot 1, changing the window to a fence.
   * w_woodA4.PCX -- Replaces woodA slot 4, a smaller version of the window 
		     that was replaced by the above wall.

CAGE - 2 Wall Changes
---------------------
These were edited from UAGANSTA'S Jail set.  They replace 2 slots in the
CoralA set.  (I realize this leaves a 3 virtually unusable slots in the wall set, 
but unless you have an underwater setting, you are not likely to use
this set anyway.)
   * W_CAGE0.PCX   REPLACES CORALA SLOT 0
   * W_CAGE4.PCX   REPLACES CORALA SLOT 4


BROWNSTONE - New Backdrop
-------------------------
A recolor of a stone backdrop, giving it warm gray-brown tones.  Looks good with
the woodA walls.
