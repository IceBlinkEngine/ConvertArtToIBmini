Misc. weird artwork for D&D Forgotten Realms Unlimited Adventures. 
 
This file includes 60 art files in pcx or lbm format.  Feel free to 
use this artwork in a FRUA mod or modify them as needed.  It'd be nice 
if you'd also mention that you got the pictures from this file in your 
module text file (so others would know where to look), but not required.  

This file includes 23 dungeons, 6 sprites, 2 wallsets, 2 wilderness files,  
9 pics, 8 backdrops, 2 cpics, and one part of a title page.  All 
the backgrounds and walls come straight from Gateway, as does one of 
the dungeons and one of the wilderness files.  (FYI the Gateway 
version of the river file has slightly different tree trunks from 
FRUA.)  (G) after the filename means it comes from Gateway w/ little 
to no modification.

Almost all of these dungeons are ones I've created from existing walls
(either walls existing w/ in this file or from other people's walls).
The Grate dungeon is based on walls from Secret in Ghaaroth's grate.zip.  
The Decrepid wood ones are based on the default FRUA wallset.  Blue
Pebble & Volcano are based on Gateway walls (which are included in
this file).  The orange slices, apple, peacock, and pie dungeons are 
ones I created brand-new from scratch, so they're new to everyone.
The rest are based on various walls found in Merlin's walls-sf.zip 
and wallssf2.zip.

The lbms are color cycle pics (all ready for import) & therefore, 
some programs might not be able to view them.  Therefore, I've also 
included their pcx counterparts (For the pcx counterpart of s_barir2.lbm,
see bluekita.zip).
