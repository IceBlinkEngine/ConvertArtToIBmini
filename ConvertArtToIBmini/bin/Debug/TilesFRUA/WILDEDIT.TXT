WILDEDIT - v1.0 Wilderness Combat Map Import Utility

OVERVIEW

Peter Kos wrote an excellent utility to replace wilderness maps in UA, so
some people might ask way I felt the need to write my own version of it.
Part of it is that Peter did not make WILD exactly as I would have, and it
fit in rather oddly with my other utilities.  The second, and primary, reason
is that I wanted a utility that you could run entirely from the command line,
like my other stuff.  At any rate, for better or for worse, I wrote my own
version of WILD.


FILE LIST

WILDEDIT.TXT - This file.
WILDEDIT.EXE - The WILDEDIT executable.
WD_MARS.PCX  - A wilderness graphic set with tiles captured from Ultima:
 Martian Dreams game, done by yours truly.


INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE

You must either have WILDEDIT.EXE in your main FRUA directory, or have it
set up for use with David Knott's UASHELL program (available via AOL).
Otherwise, I cannot guarantee that it will work.

The program accepts up to 2 arguments: PCX filename to import, and the
wilderness art slot you wish to import to (usually 1-4, but due to Peter
Kos' GROWWILD program there may be more in there).  If you leave out one or
both arguments, the program will prompt you for the needed info.


EXAMPLE

WILDEDIT WILD.PCX 1

This replaces the current slot 1 wilderness graphic with the contents of
WILD.PCX.  Note that if you want to leave the filename out, leave the slot
number out, otherwise the program will die a horrible death trying to find
a file called 1.
