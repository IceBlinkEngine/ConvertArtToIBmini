                                Cove Wallset

        Introducing a new wallset for FRUA. This set is specifically 
        designed to fit in the CoralB wallslot.  
        This wallset does not cycle colors.

        So what is this wallset. In my mind, it is a supplement to the 
        standard Cave wallset.   
        
        wxcove0.pcx is the same as the standard cave main wall.
        wxcove1.pcx is an arch type pcx. basically it is a brace and beam.
        wxcove2.pcx adds a standard tunnel/stairs entry to cove.

        coves 3 and 4 are not needs as they are only color changes...

        IF you feel comfortable, you could use wxcove0.pcx over the 
        w_cave0 spot. This will change caves pallette to match exactly. 
        For my own uses, I've removed the purple hues from caves....
        In my set, caves is still the exact colors I used for the 
        Enhanced wall set, which I believe was also included in another
        wallart upload by PCCJohn....   just remember, Caves does cycle
        colors, info I don't have because I use a hex method myself.

        wxcove1.pcx can also be used with woodb settings, as its pallette 
        is almost the same.  A decent match.   As far the brace and beam, 
        my thought was whats the differance between a cave and a mine.
        Bracing.... 

        To use this art, you must have Unlimited Adventures by SSI...
        you also must have the Walledit hack found in the UA library at 
        AOL.com written of course by a UA god JGB4907......
