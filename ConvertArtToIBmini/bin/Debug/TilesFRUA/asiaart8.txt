Here's a bunch of art I did for the Oriental Adventures milieu.  Much of it was used 
in my "Unspoken Dream" (unspoken.zip) mini-mod.   

This .zip contains (aside from the document you are now reading):

ALWAYS ICONS: 

Japanalw.pcx:      A more Japanese version of my Asian always set.  The biggest 
                   difference is that the sword has been changed to a samurai's 
                   katana.


BACKDROPS: 

Bamboo.pcx:        Bamboo forest backdrop for use with my bamboo forest wallset.

Cheryday.pcx:      Daytime backdrop for use with my cherry blossom forest wallset. 

Cherynit.pcx:      Nighttime backdrop for use with the same cherry blossom wallset. 


COMBAT DUNGEON: 

D_ripped.pcx:      A Japanese-style, rice-paper-walled interior, which has been 
                   torn and damaged. 


COMBAT ICONS:  

Bakemono.pcx:      A bakemono, a Japanese goblin. 

Kakashi.pcx:       The hero of my "Unspoken Dream" mini-mod.  "Kakashi" is Japanese 
                   for "scarecrow." 

Kakashi2.pcx:      An alternate version of Kakashi, where he's had time to put on 
                   some leggings.  

Rokuro.pcx:        A rokuro-kubi, a very long-necked Japanese ghost/monster; the 
                   ghastly fate of a woman who has died from hanging herself...? 

Yokai.pcx:         An original monster I created for my "Unspoken Dream."  Japanese 
                   fantasy and horror art has always been littered with strange, 
                   conglomerate monsters--that is, bits of different creatures and/or 
                   things pieced together in nightmarish fashion.  I created this one 
                   along those lines, and called it a Kimyo-Yokai.  "Kimyo" means 
                   "odd" or "bizarre" in Japanese, and "yokai" means "monster."


COMBAT WILDERNESS: 

Grnbambu.pcx:      A very green bamboo forest wild. 


FRAMESET:  

Drawfrm1-2.pcx, 
Drawgen.pcx, 
Drawmenu.pcx:      My "folding fans & dragon scales" frameset, originally for an 
                   aborted sentai/kaiju/futuristic-ninja mod, but finally used in 
                   "Unspoken Dream." 


WALLSETS:

		   --Replaces "Tree B" wallset.

		   --Replaces "Tree B" wallset. 

W_grave(0-4).pcx:  Asian gravestones wallset; 
		   --Replaces "Marble" wallset.

		   --Replaces "Firebricks" wallset.

Enjoy,
