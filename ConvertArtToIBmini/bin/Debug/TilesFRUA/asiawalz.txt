EQUIPMENT: IBM PC/Comp, VGA
NEEDS:     IBM PC/Comp, VGA, UA or PCX file viewer, PKUNZIP, Walledit,
           and possibly Wallcopy.
Type:      Freely distributed


To further encourage the production of Oriental-type modules, I've put
together some wall art.  There are four complete wall sets (the asian,
eastern, orient, and oo-hot! series sets) plus some indivdual wall 
pieces which can be placed in the existing (default) wall sets.  The 
latter (singles) are denoted by an 'X' prefix followed by the title 
and number of the wall slot they are meant to replace.

Specifically, the zip contains:
Complete wall sets:

Asian(0-4).pcx     This replaces the Firebrick set.  The cycling info
                   is:  Start at 66, Range at 3, and Speed at 38.

Eastern(0-4).pcx   This also is meant to replace the Firebrick set. 
                   (If you wish to use both this and the Asian series in 
                   the same module, use Wallcopy.)  No cycling this time.

Orient(0-4).pcx    This replaces the Wood B set.  Cycling info is:
                   65, 4, 18.  (Note:  Orient4 is designed to complement 
                   the Cave wall set, but it cannot be included in that 
                   particular set because of it's different cycling 
                   requirements.) 

Oo-hot!(0-4).pcx   This replaces the Rock B set.  Cycling info is:
                   63, 6, 8.  (I encourage you to experiment with 
                   oo-hot!3, the raging fire.  It can be 'blocked', or 
                   'open' which may give the player the excitement of 
                   having to leap through roaring flames!  It can be
                   a wall of it's own, or by placing them strategically 
                   in a normal room, especially a copy of a room the 
                   player has already visited, can create the illusion 
                   that the room is now burning down around them!)


Individual wall pieces:

(Note: with these, if it replaces a slot in a color-cycling wall set, 
keep the color-cycling going at it's normal levels.)

I had to keep track of a lot of information in making this zip, and 
though I tried to double check my facts, I can't guarantee that I didn't 
flub-up somewheres, so keep your Disk 2 8x8db & 8x8dc.tlbs backup copies 
handy.
 
Should they work as I'm expecting, however, please feel free to use any 
of them anywhere, in anyway you like, and make any changes you wish.
