COLOR-CYCLING NOTES:  

For those who may be thinking of one day using color-cycling 
combat icons, but have no clue about how they work, I'll try to 
answer your questions here:

FYI:  To call this type of combat icon "color-cycling" is actually 
a misnomer.  This is because the icons themselves can carry *no* 
color-cycling information of their own into UA.  Rather, they can 
only reflect the palette information of whatever dungeon they find 
themselves in.  This is why these types of icons can only be used in 
a dungeon that they have been specifically tailored for, and can only 
be seen correctly (with colors cycling right) in that particular 
dungeon!  I will try to explain the reason for this:  

Combat icons normally use colors 64-255 in the .PCX palette, 
at set (unchangeable) values with 255 being transparent.  

Dungeons use colors 32-63 (which can be can be changed and 
made to cycle), plus the normal Combat Icons palette, 64-255 
(tho these cannot be changed, and must comply to the normal 
Combat Icon palette values).  

By extending a combat icon's palette range into the dungeon 
colors 32-63, color-cycling icons can be created;  but, as 
those colors (32-63) change from dungeon to dungeon, and any
color-cycling settings also vary from dungeon to dungeon, 
color-cycling combat icons must be tailored with a specific 
dungeon in mind.  If placed in any other dungeon but the one 
they've been tailored for, the effect is lost, and the colors 
are all wrong.  

For example, if you have a dungeon which cycles colors 33-44, 
you could make a combat icon which also includes those colors. 
In that particlar dungeon, that combat icon would color-cycle 
exactly as intended, because everywhere on the screen colors 
33-44 of the 256 color palette would all be cycling in exactly 
the same order;  but in another dungeon, the colors would be 
different, and any color-cycling settings bound to be set 
differently, as well...

To my knowledge, there has only been one other color-cycling 
combat icon created, as of this writing:  JQuick000@AOL.COM's 
Cycleman from his "dungeons.zip" --and that was quite a while 
back.  I hope that "fnw" will serve to spark new interest and 
activity in this vein...
