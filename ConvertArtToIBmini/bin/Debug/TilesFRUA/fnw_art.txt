EQUIPMENT: IBM PC/Comp, VGA
NEEDS:     IBM PC/Comp, VGA, UA or PCX file viewer, PKUNZIP, Walledit,
           (and possibly Wallcopy), Backedit, Cspredit, Titledit, and 
           likely more...
Type:      Freely distributed


Here is the art I used in "fnw".  If you have not played that demo-mod, 
I encourage you to do so before you examine the enclosed art files.  The 
color-cycling combat icons, in particular, must be viewed in actual combat
for you to enjoy the full effect.  This .zip contains the new art that was 
actually used in "fnw"'s adventure;  there are other pieces of art hidden 
in the .tlbs of that game which saw no action, and which I will save for 
inclusion in future, more appropriate, uploads.

Specifically, the zip contains:

*Walls*:

A-Tea(0-4).pcx     Tea-house wallset A which replaces the Wood A 
                   wallset.

B-Tea(0-4).pcx     Tea-house wallset B which also replaces the Wood A 
                   wallset.  If you would like to use both Tea-house 
                   sets in one mod as in "fnw", you will need to use 
                   James Blair's Wallcopy program.  Note: the Tea-house 
                   sets share a single palette, so it is possible to 
                   mix & match between them.  Example:  you could 
                   replace A-Tea3.pcx in the A wallset with B-Tea3.pcx.  

                   (Special thanks & credit must go to Debbi Rapp for 
                   inspiring pieces B-Tea1.pcx and B-Tea4.pcx.)

N-Hot!3.pcx        This replaces OO-Hot!3.pcx in my OO-Hot wall set
                   which can be found in my "Asiawalz.zip" art pack.  
                   That set replaced the Rock B set (cycling info at:
                   63, 6, 8). N-Hot!3.pcx is only a minor revision of 
                   the orignal, and untrained eyes may not discern 
                   any difference.

P-Cave(0-4).pcx    My purple cave wallset.  It replaces the normal 
                   Cave wallset, and the color-cycling settings are: 
                   64-5-8.


*Backdrops*:

Firezone.pcx       Rather dark, smokey, 'plane of fire' type back. 

Mudday2.pcx 
Mudnyt2.pcx        New day & night versions of my outdoor mud/dirt backs.  

Stone-d.pcx 
Stone-n.pcx        My day & night versions of the outdoor stone backs.  

Wet.pcx            A purple cave with a floor covered with green liquid.  

Wooden.pcx         Wooden interior of the "fnw" tea house. 


*Combat Sprites*:  

fwcomspr.pcx       My template used to create fnw's new comspr.tlb file.  


*Color-cycling combat icons*:  

C_cycle1.pcx       A set of 4 c/c icons; B=Charcoal Golem, T=Pillar of 
                   Fire, W=Phoenix Harpy, N=Wildfire.  

C_cycle2.pcx       Another set of 4; B=Melting Thing, T=Blazing Skull, 
                   W=Fire Kunoichi, N=Little Hot Head.  

C_cycle3.pcx       Again a set of 4; B=Liquid Moon, T=Thunderhead, 
                   W=Undertow Ghost, N=Water Ninja.  

C_cycle4.pcx       Final set of 4; B=Hand of Brine, T=Moana Makuahine, 
                   W=Scaly Beast, N=Rolling Wave. 

(Warning:  These icons do not color-cycle by themselves, but can only 
reflect the color-cycling of the dungeon they appear in.  Therefore, you 
should *only* use them in my D_fire dungeon (for the C_cycle1 & C_cycle2 
icons) and my D_wet dungeon (for the C_cycle3 & C_cycle4 icons).  Those 
two dungeon templates may be found in my "Asianart.zip".  Please refer 
to the "fnw-c-c.txt" file for more info on color-cycling combat icons.)

I had to keep track of a lot of information in making this zip, and 
though I tried to double check my facts, I can't guarantee that I didn't 
flub-up somewheres.

If you have not played "Fire and Water", and like the art you see here, 
I encourage you to see it all in the proper context.  "fnw" is a very 
hacked mod requiring UASHELL, but it only takes about a half an hour to 
play.  You can download it at:

All of the art in this collection may be used or changed in any UA 
way you like.
