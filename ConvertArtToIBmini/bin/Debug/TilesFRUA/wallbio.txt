This art collection contains a wallset, a background, and a dungeon. All
work together (else why make a collection? :) ) to make a biological-experiment-
gone-awry theme. It could be used in some secret lab, an alien world filled
with biotechnology, etc. Use your imagination!

dn_bio  .pcx    The biotech dungeon
bg_bio  .pcx    The biotech background
w_bio?  .pcx    The biotech walls, which replace the Adobe set.



Enjoy!
