Walls Sci-fi Collection #2

This collection includes three wallsets: High Rise A, High Rise B and
Ice Mines. It also comes with six backdrops, three for use with the
High Rise wallsets, and three for use with the Ice Mines. These walls
are designed for sci-fi or modern designs, and if you're looking for
more of the same, I recommend my first sci-fi wallset collection
(xxx.zip) and VixenKitty's sci-fi wallset collection (xxx.zip).

The High Rise wallsets use the Coral wall slots (High Rise A goes
into Coral A, and High Rise B goes into Coral B). The High Rise
wallsets started out to be used as the interior of an high rise office
or apartment, but they can be used for many other things as well. The
main thing that sets it apart as a possible High Rise is the one wall
which features a window showing a cityspace.

The Ice Mines use the Rock B wall slots. There is an option wall,
w_icem1a, which can be used in place of w_icem1. Both these walls
are a sheet of ice, the only difference being that w_icem1a is
semi-transparent.

Enjoy!
